In The Incredible X Fu Hero by Mascot Gaming,a [slot game company](https://mascot.games/about), precision and strategy meet in an immersive experience inspired by Eastern traditions. Set against the backdrop of an ancient temple, the game invites players to engage in a journey where every spin is a test of skill. With elegant design and engaging gameplay, this slot doesn’t just challenge your luck—it asks you to master it.

**Technical Information**

The Incredible X Fu Hero is designed with a classic 5-reel, 3-row layout, complemented by 10 fixed paylines. The game's HIT rate is a solid 26.9%, and players can expect high volatility throughout their gaming sessions. This means that while wins may not come as frequently, the rewards when they do hit can be massive—up to an impressive x25,000 of your bet. The game's payout system also offers something extra: wins are counted both from left to right and right to left, effectively doubling your chances to strike gold.

Here is the symbol paytable for five-of-a-kind:

**FEATURES**

The Incredible X Fu Hero offers a well-crafted set of features designed to keep gameplay engaging. Central to the game are three distinct Wild Symbols, each tied to a different character. These Wilds act as substitutes for other symbols, helping to form winning combinations while applying multipliers of x2, x3, or x5, increasing the potential payout with every appearance.

The Tiger Wild symbol provides an x2 multiplier.  
The Lizard Wild symbol gives players an x3 multiplier.  
And the Monkey Wild symbol stands for an x5 multiplier.

When a Wild lands, it expands to cover the entire reel, transforming into a Sticky Wild Reel and triggering a Free Respin.

For those seeking more risk, the game includes a Risk Game centered around a Wheel of Fortune. With three levels of increasing risk, the wheel offers the chance to multiply your winnings—but with higher risk comes higher stakes. The maximum multiplier in the Risk Game is x1000.
