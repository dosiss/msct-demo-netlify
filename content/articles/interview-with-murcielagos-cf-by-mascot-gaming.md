We at Mascot Gaming are thrilled about this new partnership and the opportunities it brings. To gain deeper insights into this collaboration, we sat down with Arseniy Panferov, the President of Murcielagos CF, for an exclusive interview, joined by Alex Erofeev, a team member, and a sales manager at Mascot Gaming.  



Arseniy, a key figure in the club's development, shares his thoughts on the club’s journey, the challenges they've overcome, and the vision for the future of the team.



**Mascot Gaming (MG): Arseniy, thanks for joining us. Let's start from the beginning. What inspired you to transition from being a player to founding your own football team?**



Arseniy Panferov: After a knee injury ended my playing career, I wasn't ready to step away from football. I've always been passionate about the game, and founding Murcielagos CF was a way to stay connected. It was about creating a new path in football and impacting the sport in a different way.



**MG: Establishing a new team must have been quite a journey. Can you share some of the real challenges you faced?**



AP: Sure, it's been a mix of excitement and hard work. The toughest part? It's not just about finding players; it's about building a team that believes in what we're trying to do. Plus, there's the practical side – dealing with logistics, administration, and creating an identity that resonates. It's a lot, but it's rewarding.

**MG: Speaking of players. Alex, how did you get into football?**



Alex Erofeev (AE): My journey in football started back in childhood. Right after starting school, I joined a football section, and soon after, I was at my first training. My grandfather, a fervent football fan, was the one who led me to this sport. He used to discuss match results with me, and that kindled my interest. It’s been about 15 years now, and I still train weekly with the team.



**MG: And now, who inspires you on the field?**



AE: Initially, Lionel Messi and Barcelona were my main inspirations, especially during Messi's record-breaking streak in the Spanish league. Now, it's not about a single player or team. I've been following Arsenal in the Premier League. They came close to winning the championship last season, and I'm hopeful they'll secure the title this season.

















**MG: Arseniy, how do you prepare your team for important matches?**



AP: Preparation is key, but it's more than just tactics. It's about mental readiness, keeping everyone focused and confident. We work together to ensure we're all on the same page and ready to give our best.

**MG: In a sport driven by results, what values do you emphasize for Murcielagos CF?**



AP: It's not just about winning; it's about fostering a culture of resilience and teamwork. With Mascot Gaming's support, we're aiming to build a community, not just a successful team.



**MG: What's your approach to achieving success in football?**



AP: It's simple yet challenging – fostering a strong team spirit. Talent is essential, but so is the ability to work together towards a common goal. It's about finding the right balance and keeping everyone aligned and motivated.



AE: As a forward, my focus is on contributing to our success. Scoring in every game and being a team player – that's my goal every time I play.

**MG:  With the challenges of the sport, What keeps you passionate about football?**



AP: It's the game itself – the energy, the unpredictability, and the sheer joy it brings. Seeing the team come together, overcoming challenges, and growing – that's what keeps the passion alive.









**MG: What are your immediate and future plans for the team?**



AP:  Right now, we're focused on strengthening our squad and making a solid impact in our league. As for the future, we're looking at ways to engage and develop young talent. It's about laying a strong foundation for sustained success.



As we bring this insightful conversation to a close, it's evident that the shared values, the commitment to excellence, and the focus on community engagement are the cornerstones of this collaboration.
