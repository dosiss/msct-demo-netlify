**Special features of The Candy Crush**

Another key aspect of the slot games business model of Mascot Gaming is the focus of the developer on gameplay mechanics of each release, making every new slot special and exciting to play.

**Random feature**

This feature allows hitting special symbols (Wild, Scatter and Bonus) way more often as when it’s activated, up to 4 of one of them randomly appear on the reels. This happens randomly during ordinary game and every single spin during the series of free spins.

**Rockfall feature**

Every win activates the Rockfall feature, which makes the symbols that took part in winning combination explode and be replaced by new random ones that fall from above. It is possible to trigger the mechanic in both ordinary games and during the free spins. It works until there are no more winning combinations on the screen and can be activated right on the next spin.

**Coin feature**

To trigger the feature you need to hit 5 or more Bonus symbols on the reels. It rewards the player with a random coin prize for each of those symbols.

**Risk and Buy feature**

Due to this feature, the player has the opportunity to get some free spins after every round. In case of the win, you can exchange the earnings for the FS, while after losing the spin, you can purchase them at a certain price. This is not obligatory, but it is nice to have it as an option.

**Free spins**

The Candy Crush is a great release from Mascot Gaming that has a potential of becoming a favorite of many gamblers due to an outstanding design and exciting gameplay features that makes it interesting to explore.
