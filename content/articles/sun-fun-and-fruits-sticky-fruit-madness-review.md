Here is the symbol paytable for five-of-a-kind:

**Features**

Sticky Fruit Madness thrives on its Sticky Respins feature, which is triggered by any winning combination. When you land a win, the winning symbols stick in place, and the remaining reels spin again for free. This series of respins continues as long as new winning symbols appear, offering a thrilling chase.

What sets this feature apart is the win multiplier, which increases with each respin – from x1, it can climb up to x10, maximizing the potential rewards.

Another standout feature is the Risk game. After any win, players can opt to risk their earnings in a Wheel of Fortune-style mini-game with three levels. Each level offers different win multipliers, allowing players to significantly boost their winnings – if they’re brave enough to take the risk. The maximum multiplier in the Risk Game can be x1000.
