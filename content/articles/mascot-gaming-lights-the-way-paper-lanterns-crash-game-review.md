Mascot Gaming, a recognized developer known for its [unique gambling games](https://mascot.games/blog/mascot-gaming-rolls-out-major-updates), has recently taken a step into the world of crash games with their debut release. For those new to the term, crash games revolve around a simple yet gripping concept: a multiplier that continuously increases, promising bigger rewards. However, there's a catch - it can crash suddenly and unexpectedly. This mix of anticipation and unpredictability is what's drawing players in, and now Mascot Gaming offers its own take on this trend, further expanding their portfolio of [unique gambling games](https://mascot.games/blog/mascot-gaming-rolls-out-major-updates).



**TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND FEATURES**

Mascot Gaming's Paper Lanterns Crash Game stands out with its high volatility, a return to player (RTP) of 95.32%, and a hit rate of 28.9%. This engaging game allows players to simultaneously set 1 to 5 bets, keeping an eye on the escalating win rate. They can choose to cash out their winnings anytime, with the goal being to expertly gauge the peak of the win rate before it crashes. If they don't, they risk losing their bet. But for those with the right timing, rewards can reach up to a significant x5,000 multiplier.

Players have chances to earn 1 to 5 Free Bets with each bet they place. These Free Bets can pop up at any stage of the escalating winnings rate. However, they're only given to those who can cash out their winnings before the round concludes. Remarkably, from just one bet, players can earn up to 5 of these Free Bets. And during Free Bet rounds, there's potential to gather even more Free Bets, in line with the game’s core rules.
