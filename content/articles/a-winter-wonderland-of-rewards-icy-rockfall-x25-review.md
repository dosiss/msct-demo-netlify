As competition among [online gaming providers](https://mascot.games/) grows, Mascot Gaming continues to offer unique and engaging experiences that stand out in the market.

This 5-reel, 4-row slot offers 20 paylines, giving players plenty of opportunities to land winning combinations.

Wild Symbols substitute for all symbols, except for Scatters, and multiply winnings by 2.

**FEATURES**

The Rockfall feature is the driving force behind the gameplay, making every spin more dynamic. After a win, the winning symbols disappear, and new symbols cascade down, potentially triggering consecutive wins. Each successive win increases the multiplier—starting at x1, then progressing to x3, x5, x10, and x25 on the fifth win and beyond.

Complementing this is the Coin feature, where 3 or more Scatter Symbols award a random number of coins. The total is then multiplied by the current Rockfall multiplier, leading to exciting win possibilities, especially as multipliers climb higher.
