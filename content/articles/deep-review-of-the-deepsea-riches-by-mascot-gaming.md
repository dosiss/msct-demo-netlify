**Technical Information About Deepsea Riches**

Deepsea Riches comes with a pretty standard setup of five reels and 20 paylines, along with an RTP of 95.23% and 31.4% hit rate. The volatility is set on the medium. So, you can freely expect rather frequent and average-size wins. Bets here start at 0.20 and reach 20.00, which is soothing for both high rollers and slow goers. Both categories of Mascot fans will enjoy a fabulous gaming experience without big damage to their balance. Playable on both PC and mobile gadgets, the slot can be played in the demo version on the developer's site for a try.

If you happen to find luxurious pendants of different shapes that serve as the lowest paying symbols of the game, you will receive up to 0.75 per five of the kind on the reels.

However, the video slot can be more rewarding if you are a lucky gambler. Note that winning combinations are formed with three to five identical symbols on a payline. So, here are the highest-paying icons you should hunt for:

*   Golden Skull Coin will pay out up to 1.25
*   Bottle of Rum is even more rewarding - up to 2.00
*   Compass drastically changes the game rules - it pays 5.00
*   Crab with a Skull Coin is the second most rewarding symbol of the game. It pays out 10.00
*   Happy Shark is the most generous of all. It is ready to grant you 25.00 if you manage to get five of it on the payline.

Deepsea Riches also has a wild symbol, pictured via a treasure chest. Its main function in the game is to substitute all other icons except for Scatter. Meanwhile, the Scatter symbol, depicted via Shell Pearl, can bring a player up to 30 free spins! By landing three, four, or five scatters on the paylines, you will receive 10, 15, and 30 free spins, respectively.

**Deepsea Riches: Theme and Design of the Slot**

The depths of the ocean are actually investigated less than the moon's surface, which has always been a fascinating subject. A lot of [slot game providers](https://mascot.games/blog/the-red-horde-review) have tried creating slots depicting the underwater world. Still, the serenity of the deep sea and the temptation you feel when seeing the sunken treasures were perfectly transferred, particularly by this 3D video slot by Mascot Gaming!

Once you launch the game, you are already on the bottom of the dark sea. This background is enhanced with constantly rising air bubbles and the game symbols swaying with the water. When you spin the reels, the symbols float up from the bottom with a bubbling sound. The funny music playing in the background (you can always switch it off) tunes the player to a mysterious and engaging journey into the deep dark waters of the ocean. And every spin you make sounds like a huge water wave sweeping the transparent reels.

**Special Features of Deepsea Treasures**

Mascot Gaming is one of those rare [slot game providers](https://mascot.games/blog/the-red-horde-review) that perfectly keeps the balance between engaging but not overwhelming gameplay and stunning visual effects that don't annoy the player.
