At Mascot Gaming, one of the industry's prominent gambling software developers, maintaining a steady stream of exciting new releases has always been a core part of the company’s strategy. But when one release per month started to feel like it didn’t fully match the team’s ambition, we took a bold step up, releasing three new games each month. In this interview, Dmitry Malyshev, CTO at Mascot Gaming, shares the story behind this decision, the challenges and breakthroughs along the way, and how the team keeps their creative spark alive even as they scale up production.

_Dmitry, let’s start at the beginning—what made Mascot Gaming feel that releasing one game a month was no longer enough? What inspired the shift to releasing three games?_

**Dmitry**: For us, it felt like a natural step forward. We realized we could create high-quality games that genuinely connect with our players and partners, so increasing the release frequency made sense. But raising it beyond three wouldn’t be productive. Each release requires time for integration, for clients to include it in their promotional programs, and for players to get familiar with it. And since promotions are often staggered, too many releases could disrupt this process. So three releases per month strikes the perfect balance for us—it lets us maintain high quality without overwhelming our clients or players.

_And with that increase, I imagine maintaining quality became even more important. How has the team approached the balance between quantity and quality?_

**Dmitry**: Absolutely—it’s about more than just increasing numbers. We’re continually working to raise quality by adding new game features, improving visual content, refining interfaces, and adapting to the needs of various regulated markets. This ensures that our releases stay fresh and compelling for players and partners.

_It sounds like the market has responded well to this approach. How do your players and partners react to the increased release frequency and new features provided by gambling software developers like Mascot Gaming?_

**Dmitry**: They’ve been very receptive. Our partners are always quick to respond to new content. One part of our strategy, categorizing games into [Traffic and Profit](https://mascot.games/blog/understanding-traffic-and-profit-games) groups, has helped us align even more closely with their needs. This strategy, in part, highlighted the demand for a more frequent release schedule, making the increase feel like a natural next step.

_With so much new content coming out, I’m curious—what kinds of internal changes were needed to reach this level of production?_

**Dmitry**: Expanding our development team and optimizing management processes were essential steps. But it’s not just about adding more people; everything has to work together seamlessly. The team needs to stay dynamic and always open to new ideas. Simply increasing the team size wouldn’t have been enough to hit our goals. So along with scaling production, we’ve kept our commercial approach strong to support this growth.

_Scaling up must have brought its own set of challenges. What were some of the biggest hurdles you faced as you moved to three releases per month?_

**Dmitry**: Optimizing the workflow was definitely one of the biggest challenges. With a larger team, you have to consider if everyone is engaged, working productively, and fulfilling their roles. Evaluating performance and setting up effective incentives required new approaches, and sometimes an issue requires additional expertise, so we bring in new talent if needed. But overall, these are minor bumps.

_Balancing speed with the creative process can be tricky. How does Mascot Gaming keep the creative side alive while managing the increased pace?_

**Dmitry**: Planning far in advance is essential for this. To maintain quality, all our creative processes are set up well ahead of time. And to support that quality, we’re also integrating more data analysis, market insights, and even AI-driven tools to make the most informed decisions. These tools help ensure that our creative decisions are also commercially sound.

_So, creativity still comes first, despite the analytics and structured planning?_

**Dmitry**: Always. Every game starts with an idea, which then evolves through brainstorming and concept development. When creativity is combined with solid data, it really pays off. It’s this balance that keeps our games engaging and innovative.
