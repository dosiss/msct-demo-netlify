**Technical Information**

Mascot suggests getting back to the pesky devils armed with fair average returns at 95.08% and 32.2% hit rate, as well as using wilds, scatters, free spins, and special features to make the greenskins fork out. There is much gold on the 6x6 grid left for players to nab, and from 64 to mind-blowing 46656 pay ways only makes the deal more exciting! To get a winning combination, you need at least two to three matching symbols on a payline, depending on what symbols you have been lucky to land on the grid. Here's what the game symbols pay as a portion of the stake:

*   Playing cards from Ten to A pay from 0.01 to 0.25 for three to six symbols of the kind;
*   Greenskin goblins are the highest-paying symbols. The Blue Goblin offers from 0.03 to 0.40 for three to six of the kind on any pay line;
*   The Purple Goblin offers from 0.04 to 0.65 for three to six of the kind;
*   The Red Goblin will give you from 0.04 to 0.75 for three to six identical symbols;
*   The Yellow Goblin promises from 0.05 to 0.95 for three to six similar icons;
*   The Green Goblin is the most generous one, offering from 0.01 up to 1.20 for two to six of the kind on any pay line.

Aside from the ordinary symbols, the Mascot introduces a Wild and a Scatter symbol to spice things up. The Wild, represented by a chest of treasures, can substitute for all other icons except the Scatter. So expect Wild on all reels but the first.

The Scatter, pictured via a blue gemstone, is the key to the Free Spins round. Getting five anywhere on the reels, Greedy Greenskins Rockways awards you Ten Free Spins! Moreover, if you are lucky to get more than five Scatters, each extra Scatter will bring you two Free Spins.

The bets at the game range from 0.25 to 2.50 per spin, thus making it a fair game for gamblers with different solvency levels. If you want to take big risks, bet big, but to enjoy gambling longer, bet low.

Greedy Greenskins Rockways by Mascot Gaming is a high volatility game; hence, it's a perfect target for high rollers.

**Greedy Greenskins Rockways Theme and Design**

The action takes place across six reels and six rows set in a wild cave filled with lots of golden coins and treasures - you can't help but reach out to grab a handful of gold from the other side of the screen! The forest peeks through a misty backdrop, and the cave, treasures, and the rest are pictured accurately and brightly to enhance the magical feel of the game. The animations of glowworms add some thrill to the gameplay, while the slightly menacing cartoon greenskins filling the reels complete the fairy scenery.

Meanwhile, the funny funky soundtrack adds a thick layer of mystery to the proceedings and speeds up the gameplay.

Another brand feature, the _Rockfall_, can be found in the structure of Greedy Greenskins Rockways. All winning symbols are instantly removed from the grid to free room for new ones.

And finally, what a Mascot slot without a _Risk&Buy_ feature! After every win you register, you can risk it to launch a Free Spins series. Otherwise, during non-winning bets, players can buy the Free Spins for a specific price.
