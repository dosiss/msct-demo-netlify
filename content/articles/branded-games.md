Branded slot games have always held a significant place in the gambling industry. Over the years, with the rapid growth of online gaming, they have become an even more important aspect of any reputable gambling platform.

Considering the popularity of such games, it comes as no surprise that every provider wants to feature at least one exclusive game in their casino. The proof of this is the seven inquiries we received during SIGMA Malta for developing a branded game. One popular brand was FashionTV, a leading figure in the field who was eager to create its own gaming signature. Branded games are like the face of your company that greatly help to stand out among the crowd and leave a bold trace in players' memories. In addition, they are an excellent way to take your brand to new heights.Â 

At Mascot Gaming, we have established a unique approach when working with clients who want to get an exclusive game with an affordable online casino software price specifically designed for them. However, currently, we offer branded games exclusively to our large operators. We estimate the operator's size depending on their GGR (Gross Gaming Revenue), which is the foundation for understanding and ranking the games.

Some of our clients ask for branded games for all their casinos. In return, we request comprehensive media support, top placements, and a special section just for "Branded Games." On top of this, streamers affiliated with our clients should broadcast the game.

From our end, we offer full game development, from graphics and music, with a reasonable online casino software price. We also thoroughly discuss the themes and design of the game with our clients. For instance, we developed a vibrant fruit slot game for one of our partners - 1xBet. It comes with a quality music background, colorful graphics, and branded content, bringing a memorable experience to all players.

All in all, Branded Games are a great tool for an excellent promo. You can go all out and craft an exclusive slot machine that offers something that has never been seen in the field or develop an everyday game with a classic theme that resonates with the majority of players.

Thus, our advice is to seek a developer who can seamlessly unify both their creativity and skills with your vision and estimated online casino software price. That's the way you get the winning combination!
