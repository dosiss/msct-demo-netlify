Today's gambling market is full of various games covering diverse categories and themes. And there are several factors that influence and shape players' preferences, such as market regulations.

It is no surprise that different markets come with different regulatory laws and standards, and in some regions, the limitations are stricter than in others. Factors like economics, culture, and player habits form gambling tastes and preferences from region to region.

In this article, we are going to share our point of view on the most common markets' preferences. Let's have a look.


## Asia

When it comes to the Asian market, it is all about "fish games." Players in this region are in favor of speedy and high-dynamic games. And there is a reason for it - the region has a rich eSports culture, and you can find countless cybersports champions from different countries across Asia. Due to the player's demand, well-known and beloved themes are successfully "moving" from brick-and-mortar gambling venues to online casino sites. 

Another aspect influencing the player's choice is game graphics - a colorful, vibrant, and fast-paced game with a familiar theme like anime will surely satisfy the Asian markets.


## Latin America

In Latin America, especially in places where TV bingo is popular, players are more after 5×3 slot games with classic themes and mechanics. Themes associated with martial arts or sports also have a massive following in this region. 

In addition, players in Latin America typically prefer placing smaller but frequent bets. And this is the most distinguishing aspect that sets this region apart from European countries.


## Europe

Talking about Europe, player preferences here vary depending on whether the user is from Western or Eastern Europe.

The Scandinavian countries, for example, are more into complex games with multi-move features and storytelling. From our creations, Riot and Riot 2 will surely appeal to such players.

On the other hand, players in Eastern Europe tend to choose games with simple mechanics. These may include anything from fruit-themed games with adventurous gameplay to titles with Egyptian aesthetics. 

The Western Europe market is, of course, mainly aimed to meet the requirements of EU players. It houses some of the best and richest markets across the globe and can be confidently called a promised land for any gamer. In addition, it also offers a huge diversity of various games that can satisfy even the pickiest players. Interestingly, players from Western Europe also enjoy games with Santa Muerte aesthetics.


## The CIS

The CIS market was the first one we took over after Mascot Gaiming first started its journey. Today, the leading operators in this region are our partners, including 1xBet, which features our branded game.

As our years of experience show, players from the CIS lean more towards games with Fruit themes as well as slots with post-apocalyptic and Egyptian themes. From our games, Riot and Rekill received tremendous feedback from this region.


## Australia

From a global aspect, the Australian gambling market shares many similarities with the Canadian one. Players from New Zealand and Australia love to play high-volatility slots with exciting bonuses and cartoonish graphics.

All these insights once again prove that any game developer should first know their target audience and market specifics. What works in one region may fail in another. For example, games with martial arts themes can be a great attraction for Sweden, but, likely, they won't be appreciated by Latin American gamers.

So always remember – every game will find its own particular market!
