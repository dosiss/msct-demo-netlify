We are happy to share the news that one of our latest games, The Princess and Dwarfs, is the game of the month [according to NonStopBonus](https://www.nonstopbonus.com/game-of-the-month/2022/august).

It’s rewarding to see the game we have been working hard on get the recognition it deserves. The game stands out with its vibrant graphics, animated characters especially, and tasteful sound design but above all, of course, its rich gameplay.

The Princess and Dwarfs is full of the Mascot Gaming key features - our well-known Risk and Buy feature that allows players either buy a bonus game or risk their winnings to get one. On top of that, the game has Rockfall and Rockways mechanics. Both features complicate the gaming experience and make the process even more exciting.

The cherry on the top is The Final Chance Feature - the player receives a prize in the amount of x1 up to x36 of the total bet.

Personally, this game never stops making our team smile. It’s a perfect balance between ‘complicated’ and ‘entertaining’. 

We would like to thank NonStopBonus for giving such a supportive and detailed review, and naming The Princess and Dwarfs the game of the month. To have such warm feedback from the industry and the players is a reward in itself.
