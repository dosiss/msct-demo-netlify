Fruit Machine x25 itself is pretty simple, just as set by the rules of classic fruit machines. And yet, the variety of bet values and Mascot's brand special features add a modern touch to the game and make it even more exciting!

To spice things up, aside from ordinary symbols, Mascot Gaming has also added Wild and Scatter symbols represented with a Triple Seven and Golden Crown, respectively. The Wild symbol can substitute all other symbols except for Scatter to help you make a winning combo easier. Moreover, all wins with this symbol get doubled.

Meanwhile, the scatter symbol is the key to the Free Spins round. Although two scatters anywhere on the reels already bring a payout of 0.40, free spins are activated only with three, four, or five scatters. For them, you will get 10, 12, or 15 free spins, respectively, with an x3 starting multiplier. The multiplier increases with every extra free spin won in the bonus round.

Note that the free spins are played at the bet at which they were won, and the payments are conducted according to the paytable.
