The demo version of the slot is currently available and the chances you will find it appealing are really high. Explore the slot’s features reading the article.

**General technical information**

The slot allows winning 3 types of free spins:

1.  Zeus FS.
2.  Hades FS;
3.  Aphrodite FS.

The way it works is straightforward: win 7, 5 or even 25 free spins for hitting 3, 4 or 5 identical symbols at once respectively. While using certain free spins, the corresponding symbols become sticky and stay on the reels until the end or before you hit a winning combination. The main difference of sticky symbols is in payouts; 5 Zeus icons provide up to 3.00 coins, while Hades and Aphrodite symbols grant 2.00 and 1.75 coins respectively. Moreover, the sound and visual effects of winning free spins depends on their type too.

2.  A God of Underworld – Hades;
3.  A Goddess of love and beauty – Aphrodite;
4.  A golden lyre;
5.  An ancient jug.

The icons represented by different letters provide lower payouts.

As for the special symbols we have mentioned earlier, they are easy to notice due to the type of each one written right on the icon. The Wild symbol looks like a golden medal and the Scatter icon has a lightning on it.
