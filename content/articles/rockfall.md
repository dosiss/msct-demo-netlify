To keep up with our topic on major slot features, we will address another trend that actually has deep roots. Years ago, the giants of the iGaming market began releasing games with a unique feature, today known as Rockfall and widely used in [Mascot slots](https://mascot.games/).


## The Essence of the Old Mechanics with New Interpretation

The primary task of the Rockfall feature is to remove the screen from winning symbols to replace them with new ones, thus providing players with even higher odds of winning. The Head of Sales at Mascot Gaming, Nikolay Lobob, describes Rockfall games as void of actual reels. According to him, the feature resembles a glass filled with pebbles.

Despite the popularity of the feature and its early incorporation in slots by market-leading developers years ago, only a few games bear it. And today, Mascot has a firm determination to fix this. The company has preserved the basis of the mechanics and its purpose yet gave it a fresh feel with its new interpretation.


## Innovative Visualization

Creativity is the advantage of Mascot Gaming. The company’s developers do their best to implement features into [Mascot slots](https://mascot.games/) in a unique and remarkable way. And with the Rockfall feature, they got the chance to apply the most striking animations. Depending on the slot’s theme, the game designers choose a creative way of eliminating the symbols from the screen, making them vanish, turning them into pebbles and pouring them into a glass, and so on. In Deepsea Riches, for instance, the winning symbols float to the surface. All these development “tricks” aim to boost players’ excitement when gambling.

So, Rockfall quickly became one of the brand features of Mascot Gaming, loved by players. Furthermore, we mixed the feature with multiplying mechanics and created another widely loved Rockfall Multipliers feature! Both ensure players great excitement from more dynamic and rewarding gameplay.
