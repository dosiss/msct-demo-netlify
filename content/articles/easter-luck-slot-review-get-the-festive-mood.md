But before you go on an Easter Egg Hunt with Mascot Gaming, let us dive into the gameplay and settings of the slot to understand better what we're dealing with now.

## Easter Luck: Technical Information

Easter Luck has an average RTP rate of 95.2%, a pretty high return to the player at 23.4%, and a wide range of bets from 0.50 to 50.00 per spin. It features a massive number of 3600 pay ways over six reels. The game's layout is unique, with six reels but three to five rows. This makes it even more fun to play Easter Luck. The game's high volatility attracts jackpot hunters as combined with the special feature, it promises huge wins!

Spring is coming to all devices; hence, smartphones and tablets can perfectly turn into a green meadow with a fluffy white Easter Bunny awaiting you. The game is HTML5 built and is compatible with most mobile devices.

Mascot created a highly entertaining slot that's also easy to play, even by new gamblers. All the symbols are related to both the gambling theme and the spring holiday. Particularly, the Pretty Lamb brings players up to 2.40, the fluffy Bunny rabbit and the coquette Hare pay up to 3.00, and the prize for the Frog is 5.00. Much higher payouts are to be expected with colored Easter Eggs! There are three of them, and they can award you from 17.00 to 30.00. To make a winning combination, it's required to land three to six symbols on a payline.

And if you meet a basket of Easter Eggs, be ready to get it expanded over the entire reel and trigger one free respin for you! Such a gift is possible to get even with one wild symbol. By the way, the wild symbol can appear on all the reels except the first and sixth. And once you get it, it remains sticky during the whole series of free respins.

## Easter Luck Theme and Design

Take your basket and get ready to fill it with Easter eggs! Although there are plenty of unique gambling games with the Easter theme, the newly released slot by Mascot Gaming will definitely become one of the best. The 3D design and stunning graphics catch the eye immediately, while the lively background music and game sounds set the tone for a fantastic gambling pastime!

## Easter Luck: Special Features

Easter Luck ensures enthralling yet simple gameplay. This time, Mascot Gaming hasn't incorporated its brand features like Risk&Buy, Rockfall, Rockways, etc., present in almost all unique gambling games by this provider.

Easter Luck stands out only with its Expanding Wilds and Free Respin feature only. Once you get a wild symbol anywhere on the second to fifth reels, it will instantly expand and cover the whole reel, thus increasing the winning.

The wild symbol activates one free Respin while remaining sticky during the round. You can start the respin round as many as four times by simply being lucky to land another wild.

## Final Thoughts

Mascot Gaming's ever-growing portfolio has expanded with another amazing addition. Given the high volatility, the Easter Luck video slot brings a festive spring atmosphere and pretty decent rewards. On the other hand, they decided to keep things simple for this game, equipping the slot with only Sticky Wilds and Respin features.

However, Easter Luck ensures a pleasant gambling experience while you spin the reels, thanks to its look and feel and the high payout potential.

So, hurry to enjoy the seasonal adventure as you spin the reels of the Easter Luck video slot. And if Easter is once a year only, you can play the slot all year round.
