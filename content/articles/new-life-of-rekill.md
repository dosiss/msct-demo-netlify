heading: 'Updating Our iGaming Software: A New Life of Re_Kill'
shortDescr: 'We love our games and, of course, we do track their lifecycle after launch. We work not only on new titles but also on those which have already been released. First of all, our games should be attractive for players. So after monitoring game metrics on the run we decided to update a few slots from our gaming set. We selected a list of titles from which we, frankly, expected more. The first one was Re_Kill. Definitely, already popular, but why not making it even better?'

Over many years of operating in the online gambling industry, we have released plenty of amazing games that you can find on the websites of the leading iGaming service providers. You should not think, however, that we only focus on the development of new gaming products, completely forgetting about those that have already seen the light.

We are like a carrying mother who wishes for her “babies” to grow well and achieve success in life. Therefore, we keep our figures on the pulse to monitor how well our releases are taken by players. Even though all our games are quite popular, and we are generally satisfied with the result, there's always room for improvement.

Being an ambitious iGaming software provider, Mascot Gaming wants to impress. We always strive to please our players with amazing features, engaging gameplay, and great winning opportunities. Each of the games released by our company undergoes comprehensive analysis so that we could find out how we can increase player satisfaction.

Working on the existing slots is actually fun, and that is a great way to remain one of the prominent iGaming software developers. We have a bunch of interesting ideas on how we can surprise you but some serious work has already been done.

We are delighted to tell you more about the changes that have been made to [Re\_Kill](https://play.mascot.games/rekill). It became the very first slot game that has undergone some adjustments based on the game metrics that we have obtained and analyzed. It is still the same spooky game with scary animated elements and music, making your blood run cold. So, what has been changed? Let’s find out this:

**More Free Spins**

No slot player would refuse from accessing more Free Spins. Obviously, the more you have, the greater your chances of winnings. The initial game version came with 7-15 Free Spins, but now, players can trigger up to 30 Free Spins! That is twice more chances than it used to be! The number of free spins depends on the numbers of Scatter symbols that landed on the reels. You can get 15, 20, or 30 Free Spins for 3, 4, or 5 Scatters respectively. Moreover, Free Spins are retriggerable so you can enjoy even more fun!

**Transforming Wilds Feature**

Wilds can always be handy. While this feature was available in the previous version, it is a bit different in the newest one. It is still available on the free spin round only, but now you can get it not on the whole series of spins, but any spin. The Wild symbol is represented by a scary Zombie that will influence all the characters appearing on the reels with him, making each of them turn to the Wild symbol. The action is accompanied by the bloody blast on every character’s cell, leaving terrible red spots on their faces.

**Amazing Risk&Buy feature**

It was first introduced at the ICE London held at the beginning of 2020, where the new iGaming software feature drew lots of attention. Now, you have great control over the gameplay. It is up to you when you wish to take the risk to get even more or buy a bonus game. The feature is available in the main game, and it does not depend on winning combos. Remember that it is only your choice whether you wish to opt for this feature or no, but you should definitely check it out.

**Lower Betting Limits**

Now, you can play the game even with a lower budget. That is applied to certain currencies, however, such as euros. In fact, it comes with relatively low betting limits compared to other 40-payline games. The bet size now ranges from 0.20 to 40 coins. Remember to check out the game in the demo version first before you decide to play it for real money.

**An Additional Multiplier**

The new game version features an additional multiplier during the Free Spins round. Adding more multipliers is always good for those players looking for the industry’s best slot games. Your winnings will increase significantly, which means that your level of satisfaction with the game will do so as well.

**Bottom Line**

The iGaming software development for Mascot Gaming is not only about releasing new unique gambling games, but also about improving the existing ones. We are happy to step onto this path to make our great games even better. Re-launching our iGaming software products gives existing slots a new life. You can tell it by playing Re\_Kill. If you have played this game before, you will quickly understand the difference, but if you have not, then it is time to check it out.
