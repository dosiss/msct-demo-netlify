On February 1, 2020, Mascot Gaming released a game that would soon become one of our flagship titles: _Riot_. From its debut, _Riot_ stood out not only for its captivating gameplay but also for introducing our groundbreaking Risk & Buy feature. This feature would go on to define the game and become a staple in many future releases. As one of our key products, _Riot_ has remained a popular choice among players, a testament to its innovative mechanics and immersive atmosphere.

**A Game-Changing Release**

The release of _Riot_ marked a significant turning point for Mascot Gaming. Presented at the ICE London exhibition in a large, eye-catching booth, the game immediately captured attention. What made _Riot_ stand out from the outset was the debut of our "Risk & Buy" feature, a mechanic that allowed players to either directly purchase a bonus game or free spins or take a risk to win it. This feature struck a chord with players, offering them an exciting choice that added an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay.

The success of _Riot_ was no accident. By the time of its release, Mascot Gaming had accumulated significant experience in developing slot games, as well as extensive feedback from customers. Combined with the innovative _Risk & Buy_ mechanics, these elements helped ensure that the game would resonate with a wide audience. A long-running promotional campaign further boosted the game’s visibility, making it a focal point in our portfolio.

**Worldwide Engagement**

_Riot_ is a slot game with rich, dynamic gameplay that keeps players engaged for a long period of time. The introduction of the Risk & Buy feature made the game unique in a crowded market.

The game's design and features set a new standard for Mascot Gaming. The graphics were improved significantly, providing a visually stunning experience, and the game’s soundtrack played a key role in immersing players. With [five distinct soundtracks](https://open.spotify.com/album/2PfAiypbXk4rGDOQKnYQSO?si=1PuAOJx5SJSFZpH8CYKW9Q), _Riot_ offered something unique for every player, enhancing the atmosphere and making the experience even more memorable.

_Riot_ has achieved widespread global popularity, but it particularly resonates with players from countries of the former CIS, including Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. Each region has its own unique preferences and themes that resonate more strongly with its players. In the case of the CIS countries, the post-apocalyptic setting of _Riot_ is especially appealing, where stories about the end of the world and life afterward are widely appreciated in popular culture. This theme has long been popular, making _Riot_ a natural choice for players who enjoy thought-provoking narratives.

It’s no surprise that _Riot_ resonates most strongly with players between 18 and 34 years old. These players are drawn to experiences that push boundaries and offer a mix of adventure and intrigue. Although players 45 and older also find _Riot_ enjoyable, they tend to see it as an occasional diversion rather than a primary gaming choice, often preferring more traditional options like fruit machine games, which offer a simpler, nostalgic experience. It's the younger groups that truly engage with and invest in the game’s immersive experience.

Mobile devices lead as the top platform for _Riot_, offering unmatched convenience. Desktops, tablets, and smart TVs follow, catering to those who enjoy the game on larger screens.

Since its release in February 2020, _Riot_ has amassed an impressive 414 351 067 spins worldwide. This staggering number is a testament to the game's enduring popularity and global appeal.

**Building a Universe**

One of the exciting aspects of _Riot_ is the world it creates. The game’s theme was inspired by our personal hobbies, science fiction books like Stephen King’s _The Stand_, and video games such as _Army of Two_ and _The Division_. This universe is fertile ground for future expansions, including sequels, prequels, and spin-offs. At Mascot Gaming, we are fully committed to expanding the _Riot_ franchise and taking it to new heights.

In fact, on August 27, 2024, we released _Riot Ultimate_, an enhanced version of the original game with the new version of Risk & Buy. Players have even more flexibility now, as they can purchase any feature, whereas in the original game, only one of three features could be bought. The prize range has also been increased, making the game more rewarding for those who dare to take the risk. And the Risk game now allows for further multiple winnings.

The journey of _Riot_ is far from over. By the end of the year, we plan to launch a spin-off of the original game, expanding the universe even further. We believe that _Riot_ has endless potential, and we are excited to explore the possibilities for both narrative and gameplay innovation.

**The Riot Experience**

_Riot_ is the embodiment of what Mascot Gaming stands for—innovation, excitement, and player engagement. From its unique Risk & Buy feature to its stunning soundtracks and animations, _Riot_ has set the standard for what we aim to achieve in our games. We are confident that the _Riot_ universe will continue to grow and evolve, and we look forward to sharing these new developments with our audience.
