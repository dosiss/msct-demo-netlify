Mascot’s game developers did a great job picturing “Los Muertos” in their best outfits, prepared for the fiesta! The game symbols for low value are playing card suits, richly decorated with flowers. They pay from 0.03 to 0.75 for three to five of a kind. Higher paying symbols are more interesting, depicting the spirit of the holiday the best. Here are they:

*   A Tequila bottle with a shot glass and lime slice gives out 0.10 to 1.00 for three to five of a kind;
*   The Dead Man in purple pays out a bit higher - from 0.15 to 1.50 for three to five of a kind;
*   The Dead Woman with a rose tiara pays out 0.20 to 2.50 for three to five identical symbols;
*   The Skeleton with a black sombrero is the highest-paying regular symbol, promising 0.25 to 10.00 for three to five identical symbols.

Aside from this array of regular symbols, the La Fiesta de Muertos game by Mascot [slot gaming companies](https://mascot.games/blog/the-red-horde-review) features special symbols, including the Wild depicted by a double skull. The latter can substitute all regular symbols to build winning combinations easier.

Mascot “granted” the slot two scatters - a Gold Skull Scatter and the Pink Skull Scatter. Land two and more Gold Skull scatters anywhere on the reels to get paid from 0.30 to 3.75 and more. The other function of the scatter is to trigger the Bonus Game. To do this, three or more scatters need to be landed on the reels in any combination.

If you are familiar with Mascot Gaming slots, you must have guessed that La Fiesta de Muertos has several extra features to spice up the gameplay. Portraited via colored skulls, these symbols are Multiplier, Super Multiplier, Modifier, and Upgrade. More on them later.

**La Fiesta de Muertos Theme and Design**

La Fiesta de Muertos, or the Day of the Dead, is a national holiday celebrated in Mexico which lays the basis of the slots’ theme and design. This holiday is an opportunity for the locals to remember those family members who have passed on. In fact, it’s a merry holiday; hence, it serves as a captivating theme for the online slot. You can see the lit candles inside a Mexican house, and the grid takes on the central part. And once you get a winning combination, the symbols are set on fire. The entire scene is mesmerizing and thrilling. 

**Special Features of La Fiesta de Muertos**

What game by Mascot [slot gaming companies](https://mascot.games/blog/the-red-horde-review) if it doesn’t have special features?! La Fiesta de Muertos has several special features that intrigue and give pace to the game.

**Sticky Respin Feature**

You will trigger a series of Free Respins by landing a winning combination with a scatter. When the feature starts, whatever winning combination you get will remain in its place. The round will end either when the whole grid is filled with winning combinations or when you land winning combinations no more.

**Bonus Games**

The Bonus Game starts when the Sticky Respin feature ends. At the start, you get three bonus spins to be played on the bet with which you have won the feature. And when you land a winning symbol on the screen, you will automatically reset the number of free spins to three.

However, what makes this in-game round so unique and attractive, is that you can land only the Multiplier, Super Multiplier, Modifier, and Upgrade symbols. At the end of the round, the game will calculate the total win multiplier and apply it to the total bet.

**Risk&Buy**

The brand feature Risk&Buy suggests the player risk the current win to launch the Bonus Game or buy the feature at a specific price. This offer is active regardless of your spin outcome, so there’s always a chance to pass straight to the fun part of the game.
