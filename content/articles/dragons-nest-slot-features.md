When it comes to convincing the player of the realness of the atmosphere of the game, Mascot Gaming knows its work.

**Special features of the slot**

It would not be a Mascot Gaming game if not for the interesting gameplay spiced up with various bonuses. Take a look at them:

We have already mentioned about the availability of special symbols represented by the eggs of the mystical creatures. To trigger any of the bonuses from this feature, you need to hit at least 5 of these icons on the reels. If you are lucky enough, expect to claim one of the boosts:

*   Coin prize. The total rewards for every symbol increase the win of the current spin;
*   Wild symbol. Every Egg becomes Wild with random multiplier to replace any other icon on the reels;
*   Free spins. Claim a certain amount of spins from every Egg symbol. Moreover, free spins play automatically after the spin where the gambler got them.

The value of each bonus player can get from the “Eggs” depends on the type of the symbol.

**Risk and Buy feature**

Every time you spin the reels, the game offers purchasing some free spins on the right side of the page. You get the chance of buying them regardless of the result of the spin. However, if you win, you can abandon the prize in exchange for some free spins. On other hand, after losing, you have the opportunity of acquiring a certain amount of spins for some coins. In both cases, the winning or the price of the purchase will be automatically deducted from the account of the player.

The feature is not obligatory to use but if you want to increase the level of thrill from gambling, it can be of great help.

**Bet lines**

Even though Dragon's Nest does not feature hundreds of paylines, it is worth mentioning some details. The slot pays out only for one highest winning line per spin.

**Conclusion**

Dragon's Nest is a truly unique slot from Mascot Gaming. Its “Dragon's Eggs” feature adds something new and exciting to the gameplay and the mythical atmosphere makes it difficult to stop playing.
