Mascot Gaming has successfully obtained the license from the regulator in Romania. We have been working for quite some time to achieve this, and we couldn't be happier with the outcome.
⠀
This milestone marks an exciting new era for Mascot Gaming as we enter the regulated markets of Europe. We now have the opportunity to collaborate and be recognized by major operators in these markets, which is a significant development for our company.
⠀
Industry regulation plays a vital role in creating a fair and secure environment for everyone involved, including developers, operators, and players.
⠀
Step by step, we're determined to make our mark in the Romanian market and beyond. With dedication, perseverance, and a focus on responsible gaming, we are ready to take the next steps, one license at a time.
