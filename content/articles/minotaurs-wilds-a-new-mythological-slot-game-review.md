Embark on a real adventure through the land of myths down to the maze where the fierce minotaur guards the treasures. As one of the well-known gambling software developers, Mascot Gaming draws inspiration from the myths of Ancient Greece, transforming these tales into a beautifully animated slot game.This new release is the third in Mascot Gaming's lineup to feature the revamped version of the famous Risk and Buy feature.

**TECHNICAL INFORMATION**

Minotaurs Wilds introduces us to a high-volatility landscape with 10 paylines set on a 5x3 grid. Its competitive RTP of 95.16% and HIT% of 21.5% whisper promises of treasures hidden deep within the labyrinth. And for those brave enough to venture, there lies a tantalizing possibility of reaping rewards up to x2000 of one's bet.

Minotaurs Wilds is a trove of enchanting features but before we delve deeper into game mechanics, let’s take a guided tour through this Minotaurs lore, where each symbol comes with its unique payout. For example, landing five-of-a-kind rewards you as follows:

*   10 and Jack: A modest tribute of x25 to the line bet.
*   Queen: Gracefully gifts x40 to the line bet.
*   King: A regal x50 to the line bet.
*   Ace: Triumphs with x75 to the line bet.
*   Ariadne: The tale's heroine generously grants a x100 boost.
*   The Priestess: Her divine favor bestows a handsome x250.
*   Goddess: She outshines the rest with a radiant x400 reward.
*   Theseus: His valor enriches the player with a brave x500.
*   The Minotaur: The legend himself, towering with x1000 of the line bet.

As you explore the game's symbols, the Wild Symbol, designed as an ancient silver Helmet, catches the eye. It can substitute for all other symbols except Scatter and Gold Wild symbols. Gold Wilds substitute for all symbols and double up your winnings. If there are multiple Gold Wild symbols in a winning combination, the multiplier is only applied once. Gold Wild symbols can appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 in the main game and Free Spins.

In the narrative's twists and turns, Ariadne’s thread weaves its presence as the game's Scatter Symbol. Predominantly gracing reels 2, 3, and 4, landing three Scatters—either solo or in combination with Gold Wild symbols—awards 10 Free Spins.
