**Anksunamun: The Queen of Egypt**

Our earliest game, Anksunamun delights with a Free Spins feature accompanied by Sticky Wilds. When players land a Gold Wild symbol during the Free Spins, it turns into a Sticky Wild, enriching the win potential. Structured on a 5x3 grid with 10 paylines and medium volatility, its atmospheric soundtrack whisks players away to the heart of Ancient Egypt. The design and mechanics might remind enthusiasts of vintage Las Vegas slot machines.

**Mayan Riches Rockways**

As a prominent [casino slot developer](https://mascot.games/blog/fruit-slots-by-top-casino-slot-developer-double-review), we designed  "Mayan Riches" to offer players a thrilling experience with its Rockways feature. Each reel varies in height with every spin, ranging from 2 to 6 symbols. This setup can span from 64 to 46,656 payways. Notably, the game unfolds on a 6x6 grid, making the Rockfall feature and Rockfall Multiplier especially engaging. Brightly colored symbols and a great soundtrack add to its charm.

**Bastet and Cats**

Dive into the world of Bastet and her feline allies. Set against the pyramids of Ancient Egypt, the game blends features like Risk and Buy, Rockfall, and the Rockfall multiplier. Winning combinations give way to new symbols, dissipating with a pleasurable stone-cracking sound, making way for new symbols. With each successive Rockfall, players can achieve multipliers of up to x5. Moreover, Scatter Features, Free Spins, and bonus rounds await, with multipliers potentially reaching x15. The animated character makes a great companion throughout the journey.

**Cleopatra’s Gems Bingo**

For fans of the original slot game, Cleopatra’s Gems Rockways, Mascot Gaming has created this alluring bingo game set in a temple of Ancient Egypt. If you're looking for a change from slots, Cleopatra’s Gems Bingo offers a classic bingo experience with 4 cards for 60 balls. What is not so classic about it, is its  Extra Balls Feature. Players can purchase extra balls, thereby increasing their chances of winning. You have the option to exclude up to 3 cards from the game and play with just one. Bets are evenly distributed among all participating cards. While Cleopatra’s Gems Bingo is essentially a bingo game, its setting and design suggest otherwise. The soundtrack is captivating, making you feel as if you're stepping into an ancient palace.



From the shimmering sands of Ancient Egypt to the towering peaks of Olympus, Masco Gaming proves itself to be an expert [casino slot developer](https://mascot.games/blog/fruit-slots-by-top-casino-slot-developer-double-review). Meticulously crafted, these games transport players on a captivating journey through time and legend.
