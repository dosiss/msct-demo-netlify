**Rockways feature**

As it comes from the name of the slot, this is the most exciting part about it. Rockways feature spices up the gameplay by changing the number of paylines on the reels for every new spin! The height of each reel for the spin depends on how many blocker symbols that do not participate in creating combinations are on it. The maximum number of active symbols for every reel is 6, while there can only be up to 4 Blockers. Thus, the number of payways can go from 64 to 46656 because of this feature.

To participate in the winning combination, the identical symbols have to be anywhere on the adjacent reels from left to right. Note that only the highest win per spin will be paid out.

It also provides a win multiplier, which increases with every activation of Rockfall and goes up to x5 during a regular game and up to x15 during free spins series.
