Mascot Gaming strives to be one of the leading [iGaming software providers](blog-fruit-slots-by-top-casino-slot-developer-double-review), and the right way to go to achieve this goal is to offer amazing and [unique casino games](services). Not only does this casino game producer keep constantly releasing new interesting slots, but also makes the existing ones ideal. Based on the analytical data, it is possible to conclude how to please players even more.

Some games can perform great in the way they are, but just by making some changes, our developers can turn them to brand new exciting products. This allows players to look at such slots from a different angle.

The first game that has undergone such changes was [Re-Kill](https://play.mascot.games/rekill). The success of this experience proved that such improvements are surely worth effort. Following the success of the first rerun, the Mascot Gaming casino game producer decided to work a bit more on the already released HELL'SING slot. Find out full info on this game and how it has been improved from this review.

**Basic Info about HELL'SING**

![](../../images/img_blog_hellsing-rerun-1.jpg)

This slot was in the first game collection presented in 2019 at the ICE London, the world’s largest gambling exhibition. Initially, it was packed with lots of features, such as the Vampire Hunt Feature, Potions Respin, and others, which then were replaced with more interesting ones. Now It is a five-reel slot that comes with four rows and 40 paylines. The game volatility became medium. 

However, players have never complained about being offered interesting features, making their gaming experience more engaging and increasing their chances of winning. Therefore, the [casino games provider](https://mascot.games/) has decided to pack the game with totally new features.

The changes to the game were implemented on February 9th, 2021. You can either check out its demo version [here](https://play.mascot.games/hellsing) or you can play it for real money on the websites of our partners’ online casino. Their list is published on our website, and you only need to click on the icon of a chosen gambling venue to be taken to its official site. The detailed info on the features available in the HELL'SING slot is provided below.

**Theme and Symbols**

Are you brave enough to go on a trip to the mountains of Transylvania and fight shoulder to shoulder with Van Helsing? Do not worry if you do not have such skills as the famous monster hunter because he will cover you. You will be armed with your mouse to neutralize various monsters, such as werewolves, vampires, and others by clicking on it.

The reels of the slot are set against the dark backdrop. Do not turn the sounds off if you really want to immerse yourself in the spooky atmosphere. The growl and howl of werewolves will let you know that the danger is close, so be prepared.

The highest paying symbols of the game include the Vampire, the Werewolf, the Young Lady, the Policeman, and the Butler. The other symbols are playing card icons on headstones.

The special symbols of the game are as follows:

*   A wild symbol — Van Helsing himself;
*   Two scatters — Vampire’s Sign and Werewolf’s Sign.

The wild symbol will substitute other standard symbols. This will help form more winning combinations. It does not work this way with Vampire’s Sign and Werewolf’s Sign.

If you land 3-5 Vampire’s signs, then you will get 15 Vampire Hunt Free Spins. To be granted with 15 Werewolf Hunt Free Spins, you need to land 3-5 Vampire’s Signs.

**Features**

There are different features that you will find in the renewed HELL'SING slot. Find detailed descriptions of each of them below:

**Risk & Buy Feature**

The HELL'SING slot is one of the [unique gambling games](blog-gryphons-castle-from-mascot-gaming) by Mascot Gaming that comes with the Risk & Buy feature. There are two opportunities provided by this feature.

The first one is risking your winnings to get Free Spins right away. Another way to enter the Free Spins round is to buy it at a specified cost. Players can opt for one of these offers after every spin in the main game. Please note that this feature is not available in autoplay mode. You do not have to use it if you do not want to, but it is great to have such an option.

**Vampire Hunt Free Spins Feature**

These are free Spins series, during which Vampire’s sign lands at a random place on the reels before every Free Spin. This helps form more expensive winning combos. This feature is re-triggerable, which means that you can get it again during the Free Spin round.

**Werewolf Hunt Free Spins Feature**

The Werewolf’s sign becomes Special during the Free Spin Round. It will expand on the entire reel where it is landed. It will be paid like a regular symbol even if it appears on non-adjacent positions. This feature is re-triggerable as well.

**Conclusion**

HELL’SING is a great choice for everyone who likes spooky themes inspired by the legends of vampires, werewolves, and other monsters. Join Van Helsing in his dangerous yet thrilling journey to fight against the evil creatures and get your reward for courage.

Not only will you have special symbols, allowing creating more winning combos and getting free spins, but you will also have an opportunity to access the Free Spin round at any time you want. The Risk&Buy feature, which is a unique perk of some slot games by Mascot Gaming, has proven to be very popular, so it is surely worth being added to already released games like HELL'SING.
