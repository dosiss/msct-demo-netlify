Plenty of companies nowadays promote exceptionally eco-friendly products which won’t cause any harm to their consumers. In the same way, our duty is to advocate for responsible gambling. We aim to bring the best gambling experience to our fans worldwide without sacrificing their well-being.

The gambling market is pretty transparent due to market regulations. However, when it comes to casino game developers, we should promote secure and responsible gambling ourselves, as well as keep it under strict control.

So, what is responsible gambling? This term relates to the concept of making sure players are engaged in gambling safely without causing any sort of harm to themselves or the people around them because of gambling. The knowledge that the Responsible Gambling policy of a casino or iGaming software developer provides will help gamers control their actions and make thoughtful decisions as to when to stop playing or what bets they can afford to place. All activities of a gambler must align with their personal circumstances.

As a casino game provider, Mascot Gaming ensures all our gambling products deliver transparent data about the game rules and potential outcomes. Based on this accurate information, a player can make informed decisions, thus reducing any risk of unpleasant or unsafe experiences.

Furthermore, being a reliable brand ourselves, we always choose dependable online casino operators to cooperate with. The choice of credible and honest partners allows us to reinforce our principles of Responsible Gambling throughout the whole iGaming ecosystem. We want to ensure that our fans, whichever virtual casino they play at, are secure. This will definitely foster long-term engagement. 

The Responsible Gambling policy of Mascot Gaming is concentrated on promoting high-value entertainment rather than guaranteed wins. Also, we make sure age restrictions are strictly abided by to prevent underage gambling. This is a moral imperative, undoubtedly. And yet, it’s also a crucial step towards guaranteeing the permanent viability and integrity of the gaming industry.
