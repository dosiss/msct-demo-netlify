## Rockways Mechanics: What Is It?

Whenever you spin the reels, the height of each changes randomly. This, in turn, increases the number of symbols in height.

In games with the Rockways mechanics, you can find active and inactive symbols. Active symbols can build winning combinations with thousands of pay ways by simply changing the height of the reel whenever spun. Meanwhile, inactive symbols (also referred to as Blockers) can’t form winning combos. You can see the number of ways active for the given spin on the side of the playfield.

All [Mascot slots](https://mascot.games/) made with the Rockways feature work on the classic mechanism yet with a completely new feel and interpretation. They introduce significantly more ways to win compared to traditional video slots. For instance, if initially the slot had a 3x5 structure, it may turn into a 6x5 or another form while playing. In all cases, the number of reels won’t differ. All changes will be applied only to the height.

To better understand the essence of the Rockways mechanic and how it upgrades the gameplay and overall gambling experience, we suggest trying any of the four [Mascot slots](https://mascot.games/) made with this feature so far. Any feedback about the Rockways slots is welcome!
