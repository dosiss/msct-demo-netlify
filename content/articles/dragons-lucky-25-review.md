The Scatter Symbol is paid out when two or more appear anywhere on the reels and triggering a Free Spins feature—10, 12, or 15 spins are unlocked with the appearance of 3, 4, or 5 Scatters, respectively. 


**FEATURES**

‘Dragon's Lucky 25’ is a thrilling slot game with features designed to amplify the excitement with every spin. The game's Free Spins feature is a cornerstone of its gameplay; landing 3, 4, or 5 Scatter Symbols catapults players into a lucrative round of 10, 12, or 15 Free Spins, starting with a x3 multiplier to boost the winnings. The opportunity for retriggering is a compelling prospect—secure the same number of Scatters during the series, and you're rewarded with an additional set of spins. 

The game's title hints at the fortunes that may unfold. As players accumulate additional Free Spins, the multiplier for their winnings increases, potentially hitting an extraordinary x25. Once this pinnacle is reached, any further Free Spins will be playedwith this maximum multiplier, maximizing the payout potential for the remainder of the feature.
