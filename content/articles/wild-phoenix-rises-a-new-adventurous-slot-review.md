**FEATURES**



The main feature of the game is Risk & Buy. However, the developer introduced a new version of the famous feature.

The Buy offer allows players to purchase Free Spins under specified conditions and prices, available at any point during the main game. Players are presented with three standard Buy offers and a special random Buy offer. After every spin, the special offer price is updated. 



The Risk offer tempts players to multiply their winnings in the Risk game, where the stakes are high, and the rewards are higher – you can win up to x1000 of your total bet. The Risk game is designed as the Wheel of Fortune with three levels. By landing on a green gem, you can unlock the next level. New levels provide bigger prizes but also come with a higher risk of losing.

In addition, the game employs a Free Spins accumulation scale that determines the number of Free Spins and their respective modifiers. A winning spin increases the scale, while a losing one resets it. 

**THEME AND DESIGN**



Like other Mascot's slots, Wild Phoenix Rises combines high-quality visuals and intriguing gameplay to offer a slot experience like no other. The visual design of Wild Phoenix Rises expertly transports players into a magical and adventurous realm. Animated lightning storms illuminate the background, while the shadowy silhouette of a mystical castle adds an element of intrigue. The symbolic characters, coupled with the bright, vigilant phoenix on the left of the field, draw players deeper into the world of the game. The unified design and balanced color palette create an enthralling mood.
