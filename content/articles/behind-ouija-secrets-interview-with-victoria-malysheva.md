As a content manager, I’m always looking for engaging stories, and sometimes they come from colleagues whose work takes exciting new directions. Mascot Gaming is more than just a workplace—it’s a community built on supporting and encouraging growth. When I learned that Victoria Malysheva, who I had known from her time in QA, had transitioned into game design and recently released her first game, _Ouija Secrets_, I knew this was a story our readers would appreciate. With the game now live at our partner’s online casinos since last Thursday, it feels like the perfect moment to highlight her journey.

**Daria**: Hi, Vika! Congratulations on the release—what an amazing game! I really enjoyed every part of it. How does it feel to have your first game out there? Was this something you always aimed for?

**Vika Malysheva**: Thank you so much! It feels incredible. I actually started in the QA department, but as Mascot grew, I gradually made the transition into game design. My experience testing different games really helped—seeing how various mechanics and features work up close allowed me to get a deeper understanding of game logic and design. It wasn’t something I set out to do initially, but over time, it felt like a natural step forward.

**Q: That’s an incredible journey! So, what inspired the atmosphere for _Quija Secrets_? Why did you choose this particular theme?**

**Vika Malysheva**: I’ve always been drawn to mystical themes, so this one felt natural to me. Initially, I just thought it was an interesting idea, but once we started working on it, especially after collaborating with Dmitry Mikhailovich and seeing the concept art from our team, it became clear that we were heading in the right direction. The more we developed it, the more the theme just clicked into place.

**Q: I have to admit, this is my favorite type of bonus game. It’s always so exciting when you anticipate with each spin what symbol will land next. And I love how you visualized it as a Ouija board! What went into your decision-making when it came to the game mechanics and features?** 

**Vika Malysheva**:  I’m so glad to hear that! I also really enjoy these types of bonus games—they’re always so much fun. The idea of visualizing it as a Ouija board just seemed to fit perfectly with the mystical theme. We’ve used the Gamble feature in other games, but for _Ouija Secrets_, I wanted to present it in a more classic way that felt fresh within the context of the game. It did take some time to get the balance just right—we played around with a few different ideas before everything clicked into place. But I’m really happy with how it turned out.

**Q: How long has this game been in development, and what were some of the biggest challenges you faced?**

**Vika Malysheva**: The idea has been around for quite a while, but the game’s release was planned for October. During that time, I worked on other games and learned a lot about how complex the process can be. There are so many details to consider, and I’m constantly learning. Also, this project was a team effort—game design is never a solo job. We’re always collaborating, and that’s what makes it all work.

**Q: Now that you’ve completed your first game, has your perspective on game design changed? I imagine working on your own project must give a completely different insight.**

**Vika Malysheva**: Definitely. I had no idea how much went into designing a game before I got into it. Now I see just how complex and rewarding it is. There’s always something new to learn, and this project has given me a deeper appreciation for the craft.

**Q:  Thank you so much for such an interesting conversation, I’ve really enjoyed it! And I think it will also be helpful to those** [**online gaming providers**](https://mascot.games/)**, who only start their journey in the industry. But before we finish, I just have to ask—what’s it like being a woman in game design, especially in a field that’s still mostly dominated by men?**

**Vika Malysheva**: Honestly, I haven’t had to think about it too much! The team here is fantastic, and I’ve always felt supported. It’s been a really positive experience so far, and I’m excited to see where we go from here!
