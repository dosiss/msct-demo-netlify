**Technical Information**

The standard-seeming three-reel structure of the Fruit Machine: Megabonus slot gets totally different feel when another reel is added during the bonus game and boosts the gameplay drastically! You can bet from 0.10 to 50.00 a spin when playing the video slot and win huge monetary prizes on ten paylines. Whether you are a slow goer or a high roller, the game perfectly fits you.

Being a highly volatile game, the 95.33% RTP slot with a pretty insane 37.9% hit rate ensures rare but huge wins. Spin the Fruit Machine: Megabonus slot game on desktop and Android or iOS mobile devices!

The array of symbols included in the game perfectly reflects the retro feel that Mascot Gaming wanted to recreate. For the regular-paying symbols, the developer introduces a bunch of colored fruits, including plums, lemons, cherries, etc. For three to five identical symbols, they pay as follows:

- Plums pay out 0.10 for five of a kind;
- Lemons bring 0.20 for five of a kind;
- Strawberries pay 0.50 for five of a kind;
- Bananas are worth 1.00 for five of a kind;
- Cherries pay out 2.00 for five of a kind;
- The Seven brings 5.00 when landing five symbols;
- The Bell pays out 20.00 for five identical symbols;
- The Star is the highest-paying icon with up to 50.00 rewards for five icons.

Besides the basic symbols, the video slot has a couple of special ones via the Wild and Bonus. The premier one substitutes for all ordinary icons except for the Bonus symbol, while the latter serves as a key to the Bonus game.

Note that the symbols pay differently during the Bonus game. Cherries become the highest-paying ones with x500 the stake.

**Special Features and In-Game Rounds**

The Fruit Machine: Megabonus video slot by Mascot is just the regular fruit slot, yet with a fiery twist. Despite its pretty classic design based on the fruit symbols, the video slot doesn't yield other [nnovative slots](https://mascot.games/blog/riot-by-mascot-casino-games-try-demo-and-enjoy) from Mascot Gaming. The real action starts when you enter the Bonus in-game round.

Particularly, landing three to five Bonus symbols, you trigger the Bonus game with a respective number of free spins. Every winning symbol on the screen retriggers the round to its original value during the bonus round. Expect only fruit symbols in the bonus round:

- Plums pay out x5;
- Lemons pay out x10;
- Strawberries pay out x25;
- Bananas pay out x100;
- Cherries pay out x500.

However, the whole fun doesn't end with this! Mascot Gaming has incorporated an extra reel in the bonus game. The latter rotates during every spin of the main reels picking up the winning symbol corresponding to different multipliers, reaching even up to x500.

This deviation from the standard format unlocks new opportunities for forming winning combos, making every spinning more fun and exciting.

**Fruit Machine: Megabonus Theme and Design**

The classic fruit machine theme gets a reboot in these [innovative slots](https://mascot.games/blog/riot-by-mascot-casino-games-try-demo-and-enjoy) by Mascot Gaming. The game boasts an intensive gambling phase without triggering the Bonus round. Its masterly-schemed graphics, amusing animation, and mood-setting soundtrack entertain the player.

And since Mascot Gaming is pretty experienced in developing glamorous-looking games, pretty much fun is guaranteed with Fruit Machine: Megabonus. The design is straightforward, yet not basic. The reels take up almost the whole space, filling the screen with gleaming and popping colored symbols. You get the full atmosphere of playing a slot machine in a land-based casino in Vegas, yet enjoying the exceptional comfort of your cozy place.

**Wrapping Up**

With the closing of this Fruit Machine: Megabonus video slot from Mascot Gaming review, it becomes critical to point out that, unlike most classic fruit casino games, this one takes the importance of top-notch quality visual appearance for granted. The perfectly-drawn symbols, which yet represent the core of a good old slot machine, mesmerize. Meanwhile, the extra reel and the Bonus Round stand for tense but enthralling gameplay!
