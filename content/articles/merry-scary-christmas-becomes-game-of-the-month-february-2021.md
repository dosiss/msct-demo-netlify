You can check out [SlotsMate’s full review of Merry Scary Christmas](https://www.slotsmate.com/blog/slot-of-the-month-february-2021-merry-scary-christmas-by-mascot-gaming)  on their website. But first let us tell you more about our unconventional video slot that reimagines Christmas as a scary tale where Mr. Krampus takes Santa’s place. Don’t worry, gifts are still coming your way, they might just be different from what you expect.

**About Merry Scary Christmas**

Merry Scary Christmas is a **medium volatility slot game** with an average RTP of 95.2%. This means you can sit back and enjoy a relaxed gaming session, with frequent wins and generous prizes handpicked by Mr. Krampus himself.

Your best bet (pun intended) to get your hands on some gifts is to trigger the **Santa’s Gift feature**. You can do that by landing five gift symbols on the reels, which will unlock 3 potential gifts: a cash prize, a wild or free spins. To get more extra free spins, you can also buy them.

Speaking of buying, this Christmas-themed slot includes a very handy **Risk & Buy feature**. If you’re not the patient type of gambler, then you have the option to either buy or risk your winnings to buy a bonus of free spins.

Merry Scary Christmas is a recent release, as it only came out on December 22, 2020. It’s also the first 3D slot we ever developed, so we’re really excited for players to check it out. You can play this slot in demo mode here on [Mascot Gaming](merry-scary-christmas) or on [SlotsMate.](https://www.slotsmate.com/software/mascot-gaming/merry-scary-christmas)

**Final thoughts**

We’re happy that Merry Scary Christmas received such a good review and rating from SlotsMate. It is a great slot with a surprising and fun theme, great bonus features and a handy buy feature that you can also find in other Mascot Gaming slots. We believe these are solid reasons to pay Mr. Krampus a visit and see how many prizes you can walk away with!
