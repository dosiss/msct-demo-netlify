We keep enriching the collection of topics related to gambling and, in this day and age, focus on sweepstakes casinos. We’ll address their business models, legality, and reasons for their rising popularity. We will also recommend a few sweepstakes casinos worth your choice, so keep on reading.

This type of gambling site is new to the market yet has already started gaining traction, primarily in the heavily regulated eGaming markets of the United States and Canada. Staying ahead of the trend, we have partnered with Fortune Coins, a new sweepstakes casino designed to provide its US users with free casino entertainment of top-notch quality.


## What Is a Sweepstakes Casino?

All gambling sites you are used to playing support various currencies, depending on their geo market. The US Dollar and Euro are the basic currencies covered by all online casinos. On top of that, modern online casinos allow crypto deposits and withdrawals. All these, along with the bonus balance, are represented in existing currencies that you use in real life.


### Sweepstakes Casinos VS. Regular Casinos

The basic distinction between these two types of casinos is that sweepstakes casinos are free to play at, unlike regular gambling sites, and don’t demand real money deposits. However, gamblers may still use casino-specific virtual currency. Let’s explore this matter further.


#### Golden Coins and Dollar–Tied Coins

The Golden Coins sweepstakes casino model presumes gambling with in-casino funds. Most of them work with two types of currencies. The first type is mock money, otherwise represented as entertainment money. It’s used merely for enjoying the games on the site and can’t be converted into real cash. You can claim this currency via daily bonuses. Such promotions are automatically granted when you log into your account. Also, you can increase your balance by participating in various contests or inviting friends to join the fun. As you can judge, the sweepstakes gambling model intends to enable anyone to play amazing games without replenishing real money.

The second sweepstakes casino currency type is tied to the real US Dollar. Depending on the casino, the denominations of these coins differ. For instance, one hundred coins at Fortune Coins equals one US Dollar. You can not only use the currency to play games but also withdraw it as real money.

Fortune Coins grants its users dollar-tied coins (FC) when they purchase Gold Coins (GC). Also, you can earn them by referring a friend, participating in social contests, or even logging into your account. At Fortune Coins, you can find an in-casino store with several coin packages available.

In any case, to cash out your winnings and coins via US Dollars, you must overturn them. Note that it’s a must for every user to provide ID documentation for verification, or they won’t be allowed to withdraw funds.


## Behind the Success of Sweepstakes Casinos

The rising popularity of sweepstakes casinos lies primarily in their legality in heavily regulated iGaming markets, such as that of the United States. These casinos have something unique for every gambler. They offer premium-quality gaming products, an immersive experience, and the chance to win real monetary prizes with no risk to your real bucks.
