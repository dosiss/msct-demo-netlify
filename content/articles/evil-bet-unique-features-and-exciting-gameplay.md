Evil Bet is the newest release from Mascot Gaming, a provider that is already available in every partner casino worldwide for real-money gambling and as a [demo version](https://play.mascot.games/evil-bet) on our demo website. Released right before Halloween, the slot provides an opportunity to dive into a spooky atmosphere.

Add a breathtaking gameplay with 6 different modifiers and free spins that spice up the experience even more, and the need to explain the reason for the gameâ€™s success disappears.

**Technical Information**

While figuring out options for [casino games integration](https://mascot.games/blog/casino-game-integration), technical specifications of the games are the first thing platforms consider. As every other release from Mascot Gaming, Evil Bet is optimized for HTML5 browsers. The slot features 5 reels in 3 rows with 15 paylines in total. As a medium volatility slot with a pleasant Hit Rate of 35.6% and RTP rate of 96.5%, it offers a perfect balance between the level of risk and rewards for it.

On the reels of the slot, players can hit 14 different symbols, including Scatter Symbol. Here are all of them (highest- to lowest-paying):

*   Chainsaw;
*   Revolver with 4 knives;
*   Man with a shotgun;
*   Zombie chef;
*   Undead;
*   Ordinary zombie;
*   Monster ogre;
*   Witch;
*   Ace;
*   King;
*   Queen;
*   Jack;
*   Number 10.

Thus, it is preferable to hit the Chainsaw/Revolver symbols to win the biggest sums. The value of the prize directly depends on the type of symbols in the combination.

**Theme of the Evil Bet slot**

Halloween night with monsters, witches and undead creatures crawling to the farm in the woods is the main theme of the slot. Sinister music and spooky sound effects reinforce the atmosphere and make you shiver. An outstanding level of details on the symbols with evil creatures makes you want to defeat them by hitting the chainsaw symbol even more.

**Evil Bet: special features**

While the visuals are certainly important, another crucial characteristic of the slot games integration options is the gameplay they deliver. The good news is that every single slot from Mascot Gaming is unique due to the set of special features.

**Stacking modifiers**

There are 4 closed chests on the left part of the screen. Each of them contains a unique modifier for the game, which you can activate by losing a spin. It is possible to stack up to 4 of them at the same time. It is important to note that all active modifiers apply to the next winning combination in the indicated sequence. Moreover, the win also deactivates all them and the player has to activate new ones. If the player triggers free spin while having some modifiers, they stay active for the free spins series without changes.

The first type of modifiers is the Wilds. It includes 3 different options:

1.  Wild Witch symbol;
2.  Wild Monster ogre symbol;
3.  Wild Man with a shotgun symbol.

After becoming Wild due to the active modifier, each one of these symbols can replace any other symbols on the reels except for Scatter to form winning combinations.

The second type of modifiers is the multipliers. As it comes from the name, they multiply the total sum of the winning by 2, 3 or 5. If you get a bigger multiplier, it deactivates previous modifiers of this type.

**Risk&Buy**

Common to Mascot Gaming slots feature allows obtaining free spins at any time. After a losing spin, the player has a chance to buy some FSs for a certain number of coins. In case of the win, the slot offers to trade the winning for expensive free spins.
