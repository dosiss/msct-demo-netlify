Mascot Gaming is a young yet reliable and famous casino software developer. This is what gamblers know about the company. What they might not be aware of is that Mascot is primarily a team of diligent professionals passionate about the craft of casino game-making.

The company's history started in September 2015. Still, it debuted in 2019, with the demonstration of its first games set at ICE London, a remarkable and significant event in the iGaming industry. Mascot has created a stellar reputation as a trustworthy provider of top-quality gaming products ever since.

Nowadays, Mascot Gaming is described as a progressive company offering its products in over 500 most reliable online casinos worldwide. The company's rich portfolio of video slots, lotteries, and card games was set up based on such essential criteria as a deep understanding of gameplay features, market requirements, and innovative solutions. That's the secret to why Mascot's products appeal to all players, no matter how high their standards and requirements are. We don't overwhelm our fans with quantity; instead, we strive to focus on the quality and uniqueness of every release.

Mascot Gaming was the first company to address [the concept of Traffic and Profit games](https://www.casinobeats.com/2019/11/28/mascot-gaming-traffic-versus-profit-why-both-types-of-slot-are-important/) as a more accurate classification of casino games existing. Furthermore, besides the already flagman Risk & Buy feature, the developer enriched its slots with such entertaining and rewarding mechanics as Rockways and Rockfall, thus enhancing the gambling experience even more.

Mascot's development team approaches the task of creating a new slot this way: you need a well-thought-out design based on the chosen attractive theme, beautiful graphics, a catchy soundtrack, and system sounds, as well as a pack of trendy features. This spicy mix will never bore an avid gambler. However, despite demonstrating a creative approach to every slot creation, the company never duplicates its games. Every new release strikes the eye with its unique gameplay and atmosphere.

The game set of Mascot Gaming covers highly volatile video slots like Prince of Persia, [Book of Amaterasu](https://play.mascot.games/the-book-of-amaterasu.html), and Princess & Dwarfs. As for low volatility slots, which are great for slow-goers who would rather enjoy small but frequent wins rather than big but seldom ones, the most noteworthy titles are [The Myth](https://play.mascot.games/the-myth.html), [Bastet and Cats](https://play.mascot.games/bastet.html), [Zeus the Thunderer](https://play.mascot.games/zeus-the-thunderer.html), [Riot](https://play.mascot.games/riot.html), and CanCan Saloon.

Overall, Mascot Gaming products stand out in the iGaming market for their exceptional gameplay mechanics, creative approach, and favorable pricing models.

We are grateful to our fans for staying loyal to Mascot Gaming all these years and promise to surprise you with new stunning releases!
