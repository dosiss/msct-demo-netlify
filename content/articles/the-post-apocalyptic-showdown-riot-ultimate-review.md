Mascot Gaming, a renowned [casino slots developer](https://mascot.games/blog/fruit-slots-by-top-casino-slot-developer-double-review), revisits the shattered remains of society in Riot Ultimate, the next chapter in their gripping series. Set in a world where survival is uncertain and power is everything, Riot Ultimate pulls players into a relentless struggle for dominance in a post-apocalyptic landscape. With the same gritty intensity that defined the original, this sequel raises the tension, challenging players to navigate a desolate environment where every choice could be the difference between victory and defeat.

### Technical Information

Riot Ultimate sticks to a straightforward setup with 5 reels, 3 rows, and 15 paylines. It’s a medium volatility game, providing a balanced mix of smaller wins and the potential for bigger payouts. With a hit frequency of 19.2%, players can expect a decent number of winning spins as they engage with the game’s dynamic features.

Wild Symbol substitute for all symbols except Scatters. 

Scatter Symbols can appear only on reels 2,3 and 4 reel in the Base Game only. 

### Features

Where Riot Ultimate truly shines is in its features. The game introduces three types of Free Spins, each offering its own unique mechanics that keep gameplay fresh and exciting. 

The Sticky Wild Reels & Respins feature is triggered by landing 3 Bird Scatter symbols. Here, Soldier symbols appearing on reels 2, 3, and 4 become Sticky Wild Reels, triggering a Free Respin.

Another type of Free Spins is the Sticky Wild Symbols mode. Triggered by 3 Skull Scatter symbols, this feature transforms all Bandit symbols into Sticky Wilds that hold their positions for the entire Free Spins series.

Lastly, there’s the Multiplier Free Spins, where 4 or more Survivor symbols activate spins with a x3 multiplier. It’s the only Free Spins type in which additional Survivor symbols grant more Free Spins, allowing for longer, more lucrative play sessions.

Players also have access to Mascot Gaming’s signature Risk & Buy feature, where they can purchase immediate entry into the Free Spins rounds and gamble their winnings in the Risk Game for a chance to get a multiplier. 

Players are presented with several Buy options, including a dynamic offer that changes price after each spin and gives access to either type of Free Spins.

After a winning spin or series of Free Spins, players can choose to risk their winnings for a chance to multiply them. This feature is played on a 5x3 grid with 15 cells hiding multipliers, empty spaces, or dynamite symbols that can end the game with a loss. There are also special symbols that advance players to higher levels with greater rewards but also increased risks, making every decision count.

The post-apocalyptic theme of Riot Ultimate is immediately striking. The dark, brooding graphics depict a world ravaged by conflict and destruction, with crumbling buildings and abandoned streets setting the scene for the ultimate battle for survival. The characters on the reels, including masked bandits and battle-hardened survivors, enhance the atmosphere of a society on the brink of collapse. The visuals are both captivating and grim, perfectly aligned with the game’s narrative.
