The core idea for the next release always comes from our CTO, Dmitry Malyshev, the creative father of Mascot Gaming. 

As we have shared in previous articles, our team has a strategy of combining and mixing things up - balancing between easy and complex games. When it comes to choosing a theme for the next game release, our CTO holds the rein. He carefully considers the latest trends, our personal preferences, as well as features and mathematical ideas behind the game before making a final choice. Once the theme is approved, our creative team begins its work. 

Their first task is doing thorough research - reading different articles related to the subject and searching through the visual library. It's all about looking for ideas that can become a source of inspiration for their creative spark. One interesting thing is that in this phase, the research never really comes to an end, as it can take hours for the team members to find the necessary information and look at images. It's because a creative and unique game concept can come to mind only after multi-step and multi-purpose research.

The next phase covers sketching. Normally, our designers will draw multiple sketch versions before they can choose one to go with further. Once the chosen sketch gets the team's approval, the designer rolls up the sleeves and starts to work on the final drawing. Whether it's a character or a background, the creative team accentuates some parts of the whole image to make it stand out and grab the player's attention. One thing to keep in mind is that even terrifying characters should look pleasant in slot games.

During the character creation process, the designer sniffs out elements that are not only eye-catching but also easy to remember. They play with various tools based on their personal understanding and feelings of the theme. Sometimes, it can be something as simple as a particular color. Overall, your game characters should smoothly blend into the theme and feel like a natural part of the game.

For example, when working on the slot game Fairytale Coven, we took motivation from pictures of bugs, moths, and dragonflies. In the initial phase, the sketch of the main character resembled a humanized version of a night moth. Later on, it transformed into a real dark fairy. 

And it's where the essence of a sketch comes forward - the color pallet you choose should fit with the theme of the game as well as the aesthetics of the character. The most important thing is to come out of your comfort zone and try new and innovative ideas.

In a nutshell, our creative team at Mascot Gaming constantly strives to raise their level as artists. No matter the project, they always do their best to create something that truly resonates with them. And you can see this dedication just by playing our developed games.
