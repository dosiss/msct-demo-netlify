There's a general assumption that working with a friend or relative is not the best idea. However true, there are some distinct exceptions. Also, you may come from different families, but working under one roof around the same project can make you a family and make your company feel like home. On Valentineâ€™s Day, we would like to thank all those wonderful people who have turned Mascot Gaming into a united, friendly, and warm family.

[Mascot Gaming](https://mascot.games/) aims to break the stereotype of acquiring a family business as nepotism. Under the auspices of fate, our company doesn't simply have a staff or team. Instead, it has a family. Furthermore, we never intended to establish a family business. It just so happened that our friends and family were all professionals in their niche. We deeply believe that professionalism lies in the basis of a successful business. And no matter the family ties, all our team members had to go through trial periods and tests. Established by several family members and friends with identical goals and interests, Mascot Gaming incorporated equality in their business mentality and approach.

Our family business, which doesn't differ much from any other business set out to be a success, placed such values at the core of its development as collaboration, unconditional trust, and resilience. Also, we disapprove of the philosophy of no affairs between colleagues. Moreover, people fall in love and create families under the roof of Mascot Gaming. Let us share a small secret with our fans. Our B2C manager and Head of Sales have recently got married, and our entire team welcomed their first baby! Congrats to them, and may they have many prosperous years together in our company!

We are truly delighted and proud to watch how every member of our Mascot Gaming team gets the opportunity to grow not only professionally but also personally and feel like they belong here. Their success is our success!
