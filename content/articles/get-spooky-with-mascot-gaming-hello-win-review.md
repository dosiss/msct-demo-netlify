At the start of October, just in time for the Halloween season, Mascot Gaming rolled out “Hello Win!”, one of their [innovative slots](https://mascot.games/blog/mascot-gaming-rolls-out-major-updates), to capture the spooky spirit. Dropped on October 10, 2023, this game adds a ghostly twist to the fun of slots, inviting players to a hauntingly good time right when the pumpkins light up and the costumes come out. 

**TECHNICAL INFORMATION**

"Hello Win!" slots into the season with a modest Return to Player (RTP) rate of 95.06%, presented across a classic framework of 5 reels and 3 rows. But it's the medium volatility that keeps the gameplay fair, not too risky but still with plenty of room for those surprising Halloween treats.



Mascot Gaming is known for their [innovative slots](https://mascot.games/blog/mascot-gaming-rolls-out-major-updates), so of course there is  a twist from the usual. "Hello Win!" doesn’t rely on traditional paylines. Instead, it introduces Bet Ways — a thrilling route with 243 opportunities to win, where the magic happens as you line up matching symbols on neighboring reels.



Let's break down the symbols you'll want to watch and their payout for 5 of a kind:

*   Both Nine and Ten may seem ordinary but get x75 to the base bet.
*   Jack and Queen can offer you x100 to the base bet.
*   King rewards x200 to the base bet.
*   Ace promises a generous x250 to the base bet.
*   Cupcake, a sweet delight, isn't just for eating; it gives a tasty x550 to the base bet.
*   Pumpkin is a Halloween staple filled with goodies, offering a juicy x750 to the base bet.
*   Grab the Witch’s Hat and you're in for a whopping x2000 to the base bet.
*   The Witch herself offers a spellbinding x5500 to the base bet.



And what's a Halloween game without a little extra mystery? The Skull is your Wild Symbol here. This bony icon can substitute for all symbols, except for the Scatter, to complete a winning combination. It'll show up in both the main game and Free Spins, on all reels except the first.



Speaking of Free Spins, keep your eyes peeled for the mischievous pumpkin Scatter Symbols. These can trigger a series of 15, 20, or 25 Free Spins when you land 3, 4, or 5 of them, respectively.


**FEATURES**

Continuing the developer’s lineup of [innovative slots](https://mascot.games/blog/mascot-gaming-rolls-out-major-updates), "Hello Win!" enhances the gaming experience with two standout features. First up, the new and improved 'Risk and Buy' feature lets players take control. At any point, you can decide either to Risk your winnings in the Risk Game or Buy Free Spins at any time. Even with Buy offers, players are presented with a choice: stick with a standard offer, or buy a random offer for a potentially better deal — the price for this offer updates after every spin.

Then, for those who like an adrenaline rush, the Risk game is a chance to multiply your winnings. It’s designed as the Wheel of Fortune with three levels, each offering different multipliers. You can choose to risk your current winnings, and if luck is on your side, you could increase them significantly, up to x1000 to your bet.
