##### How to start an online casino

The online casino market is one of the few where a competent launch of a new project could bring a significant income right at the start.

Each country has its own requirements and nuances of the licensing, however, competent online casino provider will always support you informationally considering this matter. Many providers, such as Mascot Gaming, may take full legal support in the licensing, of course, only if you purchase a certain service package.

Accordingly, you should include the cost of annual license renewal to your long-term budget. It's obvious that when you open an online casino, as when opening any business, you're required to register a legal entity and to open a bank account.
