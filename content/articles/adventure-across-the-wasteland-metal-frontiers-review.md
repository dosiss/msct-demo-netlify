Brace yourself for a ride through the rust! Metal Frontiers is a high-octane adventure where the reels hum like well-oiled machines, ready to deliver a big win of adrenaline. Set in a stark, desolate world that’s as dangerous as it is rewarding, the Metal Frontiers [casino slots developer demo](https://mascot.games/) is now available for all players eager to experience the thrill.



**Technical Information**



Metal Frontiers is built for players who crave scale and excitement. With 5 reels and 6 rows, it offers an expansive grid that allows the action to unfold in dramatic ways. The HIT rate of 25.7% ensures a steady flow of payouts, while the medium volatility level keeps the balance between frequent wins and those big, heart-pounding moments. And let’s talk stakes: the max multiplier of x5000 means every spin could catapult you to a jaw-dropping victory.



Here is the symbol paytable for up to 30 one-of-a-kind symbols:

**Features**



First, there’s the Rockfall mechanic—think of it as gravity working in your favor. Winning combinations vanish, making room for new symbols to cascade into their place, chaining together opportunities for more wins. Then there’s the anywhere payouts system, a liberating feature that breaks free from traditional paylines. Land seven or more matching symbols anywhere on the grid, and you’re cashing in.

Each Badge symbol has a random multiplier that is applied to winnings from symbols of a certain color.

But the real crown jewel here is the Bonus Game, triggered by landing 5 or more Badge symbols. Your payouts are tied to faction-based mechanics, where only active-colored symbols count toward your winnings.

And if patience isn’t your strong suit, the Risk & Buy feature lets you dive straight into the Bonus Game. You can choose between predefined offers and a special dynamic offer that changes its price after every spin.

For those who thrive on the edge, the Risk Game offers a shot at multiplying your wins with escalating stakes and suspense. This game includes 30 cells hiding win multipliers, dynamites that end the game, empty cells, or special symbols that advance players to the next level.
