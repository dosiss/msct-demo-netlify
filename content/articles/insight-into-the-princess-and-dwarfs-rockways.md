First, it's the game's wild, substituting all other icons to build winning combinations. Secondly, it can transform into an expanding wild to fill the entire reel if landed during a free spin round. And finally, the Princess is also the Bonus symbol if landed in four during the main game.
*   The Dynamite symbol hides a multiplier or free spins. It appears only during the bonus game.
*   The Golden Coins symbol is the multiplier of the slot.
*   Free Spins: Every Free Spins symbol adds the total number of free spins.

The Princess & Dwarfs: Rockways slot allows gamblers to wager from 0.25 to 2.50 per spin, making the game an excellent option for both slow goers and high rollers.
