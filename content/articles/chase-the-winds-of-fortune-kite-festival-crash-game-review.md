Mascot Gaming’s Kite Festival Crash Game takes you on a high-flying adventure where timing is everything. With an atmosphere that blends excitement and tranquility, this game is a must-play for fans of fast-paced action.

**Technical Information and Features**

The game boasts high volatility, meaning that while the potential payouts can be huge—up to a x5000 multiplier—the risk is equally high. With a HIT rate of 28.9%, players will encounter both frequent wins and moments of nail-biting tension as they aim to cash out before the multiplier crashes.

Kite Festival Crash Game allows players to place anywhere from 1 to 5 bets simultaneously, giving them the flexibility to spread their risk or aim for multiple payouts in a single round.

This multiple bet feature is one of the game’s core mechanics, enhancing the strategy and excitement of every session.

A key highlight of the game is the Free Bets feature. With every launch, players have the chance to win up to five Free Bets. These Free Bets are randomly triggered during gameplay and provide an additional opportunity to place bets without deducting from your balance. However, there’s a catch: you’ll only receive the Free Bets if you cash out before the crash. The maximum number of Free Bets per round is 5, however, you can win additional Free Bets during the current Free Bet.
