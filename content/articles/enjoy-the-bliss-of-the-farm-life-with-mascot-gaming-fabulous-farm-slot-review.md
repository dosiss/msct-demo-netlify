**TECHNICAL INFORMATION**

Fabulous Farm Slot features a 5-reel, 5-row layout with 3125 pay ways, providing ample opportunities for winning combinations. The game has a HIT rate of 23.8%, indicating frequent wins, and boasts high volatility, making it suitable for players who enjoy high-risk, high-reward gaming. The maximum payout is an impressive x18000 of the bet amount.

The payout rates for achieving five of a kind for each symbol are structured as follows:

Tomato gives x5 to the base bet.

Sweet pepper gives x7.50 to the base bet.

Cabbage rewards players x10 to the base bet.

Chili pepper and Corn symbols provide x12.50 to the base bet.

Rabbit awards x45 to the base bet.

Rooster gives x62.50 to the base bet.

Cow gives x250 to the base bet.

Wild Symbols, looking like a very delicious cherry pie, substitute for all symbols except Scatters and Bonus Symbols. Wild Symbols appear on all reels except the first one. 

Scatter Symbols, designed as a basket of freshly picked apples, are responsible for triggering Free Spins. 4 or more Scatter Symbols trigger 10 Free Spins. If there are more than 4 Scatter Symbols in the triggering combination, then each additional Scatter adds 2 Free Spins.

Bonus Symbol, represented by the farmer’s working gloves, can appear in the main game only. 4 or more Bonus Symbols trigger the Bonus Game, turning into a random multiplier. 

**FEATURES**

**Rockfall** 

In the base game, each winning combination triggers the Rockfall feature, where winning symbols vanish and new ones fall into place. This can lead to consecutive wins within a single spin, with the win multiplier increasing up to x5 for each successive Rockfall.

**Bonus Game**

Activated by 4 Bonus symbols, the Bonus Game starts with 3 Bonus Spins, which can increase up to 5. During this feature, a cow and a goat symbols boost the total multiplier, a rooster activates win modifiers, and a rabbit adds extra spins.

Each new symbol resets the accumulation scale, and if the screen is filled with winning symbols before spins run out, the total multiplier is further enhanced.
