The battle isn’t over. The wasteland is still burning, and the fight for survival has only grown more ruthless. _Riot Brutalski’s Revenge_, one of the latest releases from [**casino slots developer**](https://mascot.games/blog/fruit-slots-by-top-casino-slot-developer-double-review) Mascot Gaming, throws players into a world where chaos reigns, and only the strongest will claim their rewards. But this time, there’s more at stake—something that will push the thrill to a whole new level.

Riot Brutalski’s Revenge is played on a 5x3 grid with 243 pay ways, offering plenty of chances to land winning combinations.

Wild Symbols substitute for all symbols, except for Scatters.

**FEATURES**

The battle in Riot Brutalski’s Revenge is fierce, and the rewards are well worth the risk. Players will face unpredictable twists with the Fire Spins feature, triggered by landing three, four, or five Flamethrower symbols. This mechanic grants one, two, or three Fire Spins, during which Flamethrower symbols become sticky, locking in place and resetting the spin counter when new Wilds, Scatters, or Flamethrowers appear.

The Free Spins feature offers even more chances to win. Three, four, or five Scatters trigger ten, fifteen, or thirty Free Spins. The series begins after the end of Fire Spins, and is played with an x3 multiplier.

But in this world, survival favors those who take control—players can use Mascot Gaming’s Risk & Buy feature to purchase direct entry into Free Spins, either at a fixed rate or at a dynamic price that changes with every spin.
