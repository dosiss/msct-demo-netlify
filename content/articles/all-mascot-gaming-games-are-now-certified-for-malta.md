Dear partners and players,

We are excited to announce that 39 of our games are now officially certified for the jurisdiction of Malta! We are pleased to be obtaining such a certificate and happy that almost all of our slots meet the quality standards with respect to the market regulations.

We are passionate to provide a thrilling gaming experience to a new audience of players and explore the market possibilities.

Certain certificates require detailed professional examination therefore we would like to thank our partners from GlobalLab for making this happen.
