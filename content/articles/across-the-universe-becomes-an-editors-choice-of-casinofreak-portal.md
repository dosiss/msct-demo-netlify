**More about Across the Universe slot**

Starting off with the theme of the game, it is undeniably nothing short of breathtaking. This time Mascot Gaming takes you to the distant unknown of the vast space. Even though cosmic design is quite common to online slots, nobody has done it as well as Mascot yet; untouched planets and lonely meteorites as symbols and different types of spaceships as special features make the journey unpredictable yet exciting. Besides, each symbol provides different winnings, so set yourself to discover the most profitable combinations.

Everything else, from the background filled with myriads of stars and unique fonts the developer used make for deep immersion in the gameplay. And of course we should not forget about the sound design! Mascot Gaming believes that music is an important part of the experience, which is why it creates unique soundtracks for every release, including Across the Universe.
