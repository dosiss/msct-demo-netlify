What is the best way to establish a good relationship with your partners and clients, if not by giving them some sweet gifts? In our case, it is bonuses and promotions. 

At Mascot Gaming, we believe in sweetening the deal for our online casino operators. Therefore, in this article, we will share how we do business with our partners beyond providing quality games.

- **FreeRounds**. Our entire game collection has this functionality. But we do things a bit differently. While the majority of providers don't distinguish between real and bonus balances, our games feature an obvious separation. It means that players have an opportunity to know which balance they use. Moreover, our sales team works closely with the client to discuss the details of [casino games integration](https://mascot.games/blog/casino-game-integration), including all the nuances of implementing FreeRounds effectively. For instance, Free Rounds can be given out on special occasions, like birthdays, registration, etc.

- **Branded Games**. We can make customized games exclusively for our partners. However, these terms need to be agreed upon beforehand. One such example is our latest collaboration with 1xBet on a branded game project. These unique games are an excellent way for any operator to stand out in today's competitive gambling market.

- **Games In Demand**. At Mascot Gaming, we offer game recommendations that will be in high demand after carefully reviewing the client's specific needs and player traffic. Whether it's casino games with thrilling new features or more classic games for steady earnings, we adapt our suggestions to their requirements.

- **Banners**. We provide full graphics support to our clients, covering the promo videos and all the necessary graphics for every game.

- **Proactive Promo Strategy**. In general, we offer our customers a variety of beneficial terms and conditions for multiple games they may use for their leading positions. Namely, we give them an opportunity to choose from a range of options and pick the one they think suits their needs best. In addition, we provide new game releases every month so that the client can get a new slot game packed with press releases and descriptions.

But that's not all! In the next couple of months, we plan to introduce something refreshing – "Network Jackpots." One Jackpot can be played at multiple casinos, and every online casino can take part in it. However, we have a few simple requirements as well, like displaying a banner or creating a dedicated "Mascot Jackpots" section. As for the Jackpot payouts and coverage, we will handle it entirely to make it hassle-free for participating casinos.

Last but not least, we are also developing a CRM system that will manage various bonuses triggered during gameplay. So, casinos won't have to do anything. Our ultimate goal is to provide the best service to our customers and let our games speak for themselves. This means our partners can fully focus on their main business while we take care of the game promotion along with the [casino games integration](https://mascot.games/blog/casino-game-integration).
