Mascot Gaming is a casino software developer with plenty of exciting video slots under its belt. And the company's latest release, Ben Gunn Robinson, has taken the place of the most captivating one within the adventure theme slots by the developer. Right from the first moment of launching the game, you can tell what's the theme of the slot, largely thanks to the tropic island scene and the game protagonist, Ben Gunn Robinson.

Mascot Gaming introduces us to the magical era of devilish pirates sailing the seven seas and hiding their treasures on uninhabited islands. And our hero is right there on a desert island with pirates' gold dug somewhere under the palms. Would you try to help Ben Gunn Robison find the hidden treasure? Let this review help you learn the game's ropes before indulging in the gameplay.

**Technical Information**

Ben Gunn Robinson is a game that's been put together to suggest gamblers pretty much, although it's still pretty simple deep down, given the standard 5x3 grid and only ten paylines. However, note that the highest win per bet is paid from leftmost to right and rightmost to left.

The slot is mobile-friendly and not downloadable. You also don't need to buy online casino software since it's widely launchable across desktop and mobile casino sites.

The slot is more catered to slow-goers who don't risk big and play with small bets. The betting range starts at 0.20 and ends at 50.00 per spin.

Mascot Gaming has perfectly rendered the feel of a tropical island and treasure hunting through the game's symbols. Every icon used in the slot perfectly blends into the theme. Particularly, the array of symbols includes:

* Pretty Turtle is the lowest paying icon, awarding a gambler with up to 0.50 for five of a kind;

* Pineapple is a bit more generous and promises 1.00 if you manage to get five of a kind on a payline;    

* Bananas can bring a 2.50 prize for landing five identical symbols;   

* Coconut ensures 5.00 for five symbols on a payline;

* Crab on a bottle awards from 1.00 to 10.00 for three to five of a kind;    

* Brown Fish is worth up to 25.00 for five of a kind;   

* The Fish on a green leave is even more rewarding, as you can get 100.00 for landing five for them on a payline;  

* Seagull is the highest-paying symbol with such a high reward as 250.00 for five of a kind.

The special features are made into the theme, too. The wild symbol, represented by a chest of gold, can substitute all other symbols except the Bonus symbol to help the player build more winning combinations.

As for the Bonus symbol, it's pictured via a map. Expect it only on the first, third, and fifth reels. Although Ben Gunn Robinson is a pretty entertaining slot per se, to make the most of the gameplay, you should try to land three Bonus symbols and trigger the bonus game. That's when the biggest fun will start!

**Special In-Game Rounds**

Once you have landed bonus symbols on the first, third, or fifth reels, the map be activated! You can choose five locations out of eight on it and collect the Super Bonus Game key pieces. Expect to also reveal pretty big, up to 50x the total bet, prizes under the marks on the map. And once the MISS symbol comes up, the Bonus game ends. You will either get back to the basic game or launch the Super Bonus game if you have managed to land the necessary five pieces of the key.

The Super Bonus game is not a complicated in-game round. You actually have to choose one of the two chests displayed. One of them hides a big multiplier, and if you reveal it, it applies to your winnings from the Bonus Game.

And finally, Mascto's brand Gamble feature is also applied in the Ben Gunn Robinson game. Every time you win, the game suggests guessing the highest card. If you are a success, your win is doubled, and you get the opportunity to gamble again. But if you lose, your entire winnings get burned. When choosing a matching card, your balance will remain intact.

You don't have to download or buy online casino software products to enjoy all this fun. The game is available for instant play on the provider's website and many leading online casinos.

**Ben Gunn Robinson: Theme and Design**

Although the theme of the Ben Gunn Robinson game can hardly break new ground, from a visual standpoint, the video slot is pretty amazing. The slot strikes a good balance that gives something old and new at once: you are familiar with the theme, yet it's delivered from a fresh perspective.

The moment you launch the slot, you are visually transported to a tropical paradise with palm trees, golden sand, enticing blue waters, and the game hero, swashbuckling Ben Gunn Robinson himself, living his best life on the island.

The visuals of the video slot by Mascot Gaming extend all the way to the symbols on the reel that perfectly complement the scenery. The immersive soundtrack and realistic sounds of spinning the reels make you feel a part of the adventure, the classic tale of hunting buried treasures on desert islands.

That's why we can firmly assume Ben Gunn Robinson is a great video slot that follows a proven formula to provide a fun and engaging gambling experience.
