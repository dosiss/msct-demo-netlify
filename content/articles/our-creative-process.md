The path leading to a real and successfully completed project is quite challenging and full of various difficulties and adventures.

In slot game development, the creative phase is always tricky since the key goal is to bring to the player's table something they can genuinely relate to, apart from just delivering a unique vision. While the technical aspects lay the foundation of the game, music and graphics are the paint and colors responsible for the atmosphere. It’s because the first thing that catches the player's attention is the audiovisual aesthetics that set the mood of the game. Only after that do they slowly start to notice the special technical features. 

We understand that in order to offer our players a one-of-a-kind gambling experience, we need to combine exciting game mechanics with eye-catching visuals. 

For each game we develop, whether it covers familiar themes or something exclusively new, we have our unique vision. We avoid overburdening our slots with too many elements, often approaching graphic design with a dash of humor to keep things light. Yet, the inspiration for creating a particular atmosphere is a result of our personal experience, which, combined with user preferences and even the geographic locations around the globe, give birth to pretty special game ideas.

Let's take one of our games, Purple Pills, as an example. It pays homage to the D12 song Purple Hills, and gamers can even hear this familiar melody in the soundtrack. "For The Realm" and "Hordes" pay homage to our favorite computer games from childhood. Personal experiences fill our creative work with more depth, helping us to think of more unique and creative solutions. But this is not the only force in our creative process.

We always follow the market trends and regularly check out new game releases from the industry giants. However, achieving the right balance is too important - not staying behind rival companies and keeping your vision simultaneously. Every game developer should find the sweet spot where their creativity meets the market demands.


## What is Our Creative Approach?

So, what's exactly our creative approach? When it comes to crafting characters, there is a need for some elements that are visually simple to recognize. We try to show that all the objects and characters existing in the game belong to a specific aesthetics. In addition, our graphic designers rely on their instincts to convey the essence of the core concept and bring it to life.

Another vital aspect of our creative process is music. It is a powerful yet delicate force that can easily impact people's emotions and behavior and form their opinions about something. We pay close attention to the soundtrack and musical background of every game we develop and create every sound and melody from the ground using a variety of instruments.

All our teams work harmoniously with each other, guided by our talented and experienced Art Director. While there are times when things receive instant approval, these cases are quite rare. Normally, there are multiple revisions before reaching the final result. This is helpful advice for all developers who are just at the beginning of their creative journey. To sniff out the perfect creative solution for your project, going deep into the subject and doing thorough research is always a must. Gathering references, reading various articles, and making mood boards - all this can become a source of inspiration. The more comprehensive your research, the closer you are to finding the best solution.

P.S. Loving what you do makes a huge difference.
