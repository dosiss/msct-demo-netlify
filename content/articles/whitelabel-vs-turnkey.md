##### White Label vs. Turnkey. What to choose?

Starting an article with platitudes is not the best decision but we can't but say that casino software market grows year by year. If you are eager to launch your own casino business you'll have to explore a lot of offers from different gambling developers. Usually there are two ways of gaming project creation: casino software development from scratch - Turnkey casino solution or purchase of ready-to-operate casino solution - White Label software.

So, how to make a right choice? In this article we'll analyze both White Label and Turnkey casino development, as well as advantages and pitfalls of both methods. We'll check how [game integration](/blog/casino-game-integration) will look like in both cases.

##### What is the White Label?

White Label is the most popular method of the new online casino launch. In an ideal scenario it means that developer provides ready-to-operate solution, which is tested many times and perfected due to extensive developer's experience. Nevertheless even the ready solution has to be customized according to client's needs.

What work should be implemented before White Label project launch?

In the first place client should determine the market where he is going to work (the geography of his business). Why it's the thing of utmost importance? When casino owner plans to operate the gaming set that is not familiar to players of that market, he risks to have only indifference to his casino, because in different countries different games are popular. So [relevant games integration](/blog/casino-game-integration) is crucial for business. Respectable developer usually possesses imposing gaming portfolio and on White Label mode casino games from this portfolio are usually available in full. Usually experienced developer knows what games are popular in specific countries, that means that his client will operate the best gaming set. Obviously that business geography also affects languages and currencies available at online casino website. Determination of the market is important even for the casino website design, ads banners layout, colour scheme etc.


The next important point is project management - you need to determine the staffing and role of each employee and their rights of access to the casino management system. In other words you have to separate employees rights, for example, casino administrator will have an access only to games and traffic statistics, while managing director will have an access to finance and players data. The next step for developer and operator - to confirm bonus system. Usually White Label solutions include ready bonus set and operator can only deactivate one of them or change terms of bonuses, for example, change the deposit amount.

White Label casino sometimes can provide you with ready partner marketing solution - affiliate marketing tools. If you decide to use it, you'll have to determine partner program terms, as in the case with bonuses (motivation amount, etc.)

The other significant question with white label development is the payment processing. Operator chooses how to perform money transactions: with his own license or with the developers' one. First case is evident - operator cooperate with payment systems on his own. In other case operator join developers' payment protocol and all transactions process through operator: account replenishments, payouts, affiliates payments etc.

##### What is the Turnkey casino development?

In that case everything is clear from the name: gaming software creates from scratch according to client wishes. Professional developer have to have abilities enough to fulfill all clients ideas and requests. Moreover developer's experience helps to implement really unique and profitable casino. One of the important advantage of Turnkey online casino development is flexibility of cooperation. Turnkey solution can be fully developed & implemented by casino provider, or some project functionality can be done by client employees if needed (e.g. programming or customization). Despite of developers help throughout all creative stages you should have some specific knowledges in igaming, because you will definitely face a lot of important questions to solve. Nevertheless, ordering your casino on the Turnkey basis, you get a project in your full ownership, that allows you to control it completely independently.
