Mascot Gaming uses playing cards Ten, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace as the low-paying symbols. They pay from only 0.30 to 0.90 for five of a kind. Meanwhile, the wood animals are significantly more generous. Particularly, they pay out the following way:

*   Bear pays from 0.15 to 4.00 for three to five of a kind;
*   Wolf pays from 0.02 to 10.00 for two to five of a kind.

The wild symbol of the game is the deer. It can substitute all other symbols to help form winning combinations more often. Besides, it triggers the special Wild feature for even more engaging gameplay!

Those were the main symbols of the video slot. Aside from them, the game presents several special symbols - multipliers and modifiers. For instance, the howling wolf is the game Multiplier. It adds the multiplier to the total win multiplier. The stone bear is the Super Multiplier which, accordingly, adds a super multiplier to the overall win multiplier. The deer standing on the back two feet is the Giant Multiplier, while the black cat is the Modifier. It multiplies the overall win multiplier.

**WildLife Riches: Theme and Design**

Due to both placid and bold design, WildLife Riches boasts a one-of-a-kind look and feel from the very first chord. The background perfectly transfers the feel of the wildlife with lush leaves swaying with the wind (amazing animations) and the grand canyon visible in the background. Meanwhile, the music accompaniment that sounds like a safari tour is the icing on the cake!

**Special Features of WildLife Riches**

The game has a variety of gameplay perks, so before you start spinning the reels, check out what's on offer in the canyon depths.

**Wild Feature**

The biggest "rich" of the game is the Wild Feature. The Wild symbol, denominated with a head of a deer, moves across the reels from left to the right with one reel per spin. Every time the wild symbol reaches the fifth reel, this special feature ends. It only works when the slot's wild symbol appears on a bet.

**Bonus Round**

Like in many other video slots by Mascot Gaming [slot game providers](https://mascot.games/blog/the-red-horde-review), there is a bonus scale in WildLife Riches. It fills up by one step with every spin that doesn't end with a win. On the other hand, the bonus scale empties when you get a win. It takes ten losses to fill up the scale, though every bet level comes with a unique accumulation. Particularly, you can trigger the Bonus game and make the most of the WildLife Riches video slot. The game features three bonus spins and is played with the bet you have won the bonus. Every time you get a winning spin, the number of bonus spins is reset to three. Expect to meet only the special symbols mentioned above. Those are three to five Multiplier, Super Multiplier, Giant Multiplier, Modifier, and Upgrade symbols. When your Bonus Game comes to an end, whatever multipliers you have won will be applied to the bet you stepped into it.

**Extra Bonus**

Another fantastic feature is the Extra Bonus - it can give you the maximum possible win! If fortune is on your side, you will fill up all the reels with the winning symbols. Provided you still have the bonus spins remaining, your Bonus game will end, and all the remaining spins will be used as a Modifier.

**Risk'N'Buy**

And finally, the iconic Risk'N'Buy feature will free you from the need to wait for the bonus game to start. After every win, you are suggested to exchange your win to start the Bonus game - the Risk feature. Or you can pay to start the game - the Buy feature. Note that the feature isn't available in Autoplay mode.

**Closing Thoughts**

When you play the WildLife Riches, you will be surprised with how much fun you get since it is not only rich in cool visual designs and solid mechanics for gameplay but also packed with special features. Don't lose your chance to grab the riches Mascot Gaming offers!
