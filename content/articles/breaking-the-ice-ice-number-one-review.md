**Features**

One of the standout features of Ice Number One is the Free Spins with a Side Bet feature. Before the series of Free Spins begins, players should place a side bet and predict the winners of the Free Spins. There are four teams playing, and correctly guessing the \#1 winner grants a x5 multiplier. Accurately predicting both the \#1 and \#4 winners increases the multiplier to x10, while guessing the top three winners results in a x25 multiplier, applied to the total win of the Free Spins series.
